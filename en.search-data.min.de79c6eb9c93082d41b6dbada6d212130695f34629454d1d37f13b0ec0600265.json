I hope that by reading it you will see that ringing call changes in the way they ring them in Devon and the South West, or more particularly the focus on call changes as a performance rather than just as a transition step before .moving on’ to method ringing, could be good for your band.\nI have always been interested in Devon call change ringing, with most of that period of interest being not really understanding why the bands don’t get bored. Coming from a strong method ringing background myself I am very driven by the pursuit of technical challenge, and ringing the same call changes week in week out didn’t seem to cut the mustard.\nHowever I noted that some of my method ringing friends who have rung really difficult stuff and hence are way up into nosebleed inducing heights of the Black Zone, have moved to the South West and embraced call change ringing. That made my ears prick up.\nThen when I became President of the Central Council I started thinking about call change ringing a bit more, wondering whether there aren’t actually lots of bands which would be better served if good call change ringing was the target rather than as happens in all too many towers, call changes is seen as a stepping stone to unfulfilling Bob or Grandsire Doubles.\nAt the start of the pandemic, I joined a Zoom call with some ringers from Suffolk and I talked about having call change ringing as the target, and one attendee said “If I could go back to my tower and say we were going to ring call changes rather than struggling to ring Bob Doubles they’ll love me forever.” In the summer of 2021 we went on a family holiday to Devon and were fortunate enough to find that the Kingsteinton outing to Exeter was on our first day there, and we were invited to join them. This was our first experience of ringing with a top call change band, and we joined with some trepidation. However, we settled in and from that point on I was convinced that this form of change ringing needed to be practiced more widely. The ringing up and down was exceptional!\nThis book therefore is not being written by some seasoned call change professional, but by someone who has started to integrate Devon call change ringing in the repertoire of a method ringing tower because I can see the value of doing it. I am basically writing it as I go along and hope that if you follow this you will also find a fulfilling addition to your repertoire.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/callchanges/docs/020-down-there/","title":"Chapter 1 - They’re different down there","section":"Docs","content":"Chapter 1 They’re different down there #  When visiting a call change tower in the South West, if they ask which bell you usually ring, don’t be a smart Alec and say “any of them”. That will not endear you to the locals. Just pick a middle bell to be safe. Treble and Tenor are specialist subjects so definitely don’t say the Treble unless you really are an expert, and only say tenor if you don’t really have another option.\nThere is some slightly different language for method ringing. Method is often used in the singular when method ringers might use plural. “He does method as well” or “That tower does method”. You get used to it.\nMethod towers and call change towers seem to respect each other, and ringers who want to follow either code find the right home for them. Some ringers do both, and some don’t. The Devonshire Association is the call change association while the Guild of Devonshire Ringers caters for those wanting to ring methods.\nFrom the start I am going to annoy some ringers in Cornwall and other parts of the South West by referring to this genre as ‘Devon Call Changes’. The style if practiced elsewhere in the south west, in particular further west than Devon into Cornwall. However Devon Call Changes is an established term and I don’t think it’s my job to come up with a new word for it.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/callchanges/docs/030-first-principles/","title":"Chapter 2 - First Principles","section":"Docs","content":"Chapter 2 First Principles #  There are a few things that set Devon calls apart from the sort you are used to.\nClosed handstoke leads! #  OK, so some of your ringers probably ring with closed handstroke leads anyway and you have given up telling them about it. A perfect open handstroke lead is actually quite difficult to achieve, and what is perfect anyway? You may be told to leave a whole bell’s gap, but actually about three quarters of a bell’s gap sounds OK. The best 12 bell bands perfect something even narrower and call it ‘style’.\nDevon call change ringing is done with closed handstroke leads, which is sometimes referred to elsewhere as ‘cartwheeling’. More about how to do this later.\nRinging up and down #  When the Devon ringers ring in competitions, and most of the rest of the time too, they ring up and down at the beginning and end of each piece of ringing, which they will call a peal. This means they get very good at ringing up and down. Ringing the bells up and down is no longer just a means to an end – it is of equal importance to the rest of the ringing and is where competitions are won and lost.\nHowever, if you are starting your band off ringing in the style you don’t necessarily have to do the ringing up and down bit. Yet.\nFixed peals #  Devon call change peals do not focus on the ‘musical changes’ that you are used to. They don’t go for a set that you might use for a wedding, going for instance from Queens, then Kings, and back, or you might mix Tittums and something else. The Devonians don’t do that, but ring long established and very formulaic sequences that many of the ringers know by heart. To be honest they are not musical in that sense at all, but that’s not the point.\nRinging one of those sequences, the famous “Sixty on Thirds” will be your first target, but there will be stages to go through before that.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/callchanges/docs/040-getting-started/","title":"Chapter 3 – Getting Started","section":"Docs","content":"Chapter 3 – Getting Started #  In this chapter I am just going to talk about getting the band ringing rounds with a closed handstroke lead. Even this is quite an exhilarating thing to do and should be your first target. So the treble’s handstroke will strike straight after the tenor’s backstroke has struck and there should be no way of telling which is the handstroke and which is the backstroke without looking.\nThat tends to be how you ring up, provided you ring up well (easier said than done). Good ringing up keeps the treble striking immediately after the tenor all the way up, and a handstroke gap is only introduced when you get to the top and are approaching setting the bells.\nWhat you need to perfect is ringing rounds quickly with a closed handstroke lead without speeding up and starting to ring down! That can easily happen. Why do I say quickly? Because it sounds better and is easier to keep in rhythm.\nGood Devon call change bands ring fast, with the bells at or slightly below the balance so don’t be scared – push them in.\nThe closed handstroke lead strikes straight after the tenor\nIf you went up into the tower and watched bells being rung to rounds by a band which rings with an open handstroke lead, you would see that at handstroke the bells are at or slightly past the balance, but at backstoke the bell doesn’t get to the balance. That is showing the pause that we have at the handstroke lead.\nFor some inexplicable reason, and I have never really understood this, the pause that you feel at handstroke when ringing the treble disappears the further round the circle you go. It’s really quite exaggerated when you ring the treble, whereas the person on the tenor won’t feel as they are making any adjustment at all. It’s a bit odd.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/callchanges/docs/110-rope-route/","title":"Rope Routes","section":"Docs","content":"Rope Routes #  Under construction\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/callchanges/docs/120-ropes/","title":"Ropes","section":"Docs","content":"Ropes #  Under construction\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/callchanges/docs/130-bells/","title":"Bells","section":"Docs","content":"Bells #  Under construction\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/callchanges/docs/140-chiming-hammers/","title":"Chiming Hammers","section":"Docs","content":"Chiming Hammers #  Under construction\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/callchanges/docs/150-maintenance-schedule/","title":"Maintenance Schedule","section":"Docs","content":"Maintenance Schedule #  An online version of this will be introduced in due course.

Some other technical terms may not be familiar to ringers. We hope to have included all of these here. They are linked from the text in the various chapters.\nArgent #  The central boss on the crown of older bells, around which the canons are grouped. These are used to attach the bell to the headstock.\nBaldrick #  A U-shaped metal strap with leather lining from which clappers used to be suspended. The name originates from a belt worn over one shoulder to support a sword or bugle and is sometimes referred to as a \u0026lsquo;baldric\u0026rsquo;.\nCanons #  (Sometimes \u0026lsquo;Cannons\u0026rsquo;). The loops cast onto the crown of older bells, by which the bells is suspended from the headstock.\nClapper #  The component suspended inside a bell which, when the bell is swung, strikes the bell to produce the note. See Clappers.\nCoach Bolts #  Coach bolts (sometimes referred to as \u0026lsquo;Carriage Bolts\u0026rsquo;) are used in a bell installation for bolting a wooden component to either a metal or wooden component - most often to bolt a stay onto a headstock. The square section under the domed head bites into the wood, securing the head while the nut is tightened.\nFretting #  Fretting refers to wear damage of loaded surfaces in contact with little or no lubrication, encountering movement tangential to the surface. Fretting is caused by adhesion of surface asperities, which are then broken by the small movement.\nGrease Nipple #  Designs vary, but this is a device for lubricating a component with moving parts. A grease gun locks on to the nipple and grease can be pumped in. The picture above is of a grease nipple (arrowed) on a clapper clevis, which allows lubrication of the clapper bush \u0026ndash; see Clappers. Grease nipples may be found on ball bearing housings: these are used to charge the bearing with grease on manufacture and should not be pumped with grease during use. This is a sure way of damaging the seals on the bearing \u0026ndash; see Bearings.\nGudgeons #  The steel shafts fixed to the headstock that form the axle about which the bell rotates.\nHeadstock #  A wood or metal beam supporting the bell. The wheel, stay and gudgeons are attached to the headstock.\nPsittacosis #  Psittacosis is an infection of birds caused by the bacterium Chlamydia psittaci. Birds can transmit C. psittaci to humans; the resulting infection is also known as psittacosis or ornithosis.\nWheel #  A circular wooden component attached to the headstock by which the rope is attached to the bell, permitting it to be rung full circle. See Wheels.\nImage Credits #     Glossary Item Details     Coach Bolts Photo: Robin Shipp   Grease Nipple Enlarged from photo by Allen Nunley     Version 0.1 (pre-publication), March 2022\n© 2022 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"}]
