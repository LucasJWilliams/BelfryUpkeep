[{"id":0,"href":"/docs/010-introduction/","title":"Introduction","section":"Docs","content":" Introduction # Details of a bell installation are out of sight and out of mind for a surprising number of ringers but will soon be obvious if their upkeep is neglected. At the least, the bells may become progressively more difficult to handle, leading to poor striking, discouraging ringers and frightening away learners. At worst, it could result in expensive damage to the installation.\nThis online document is addressed primarily at Steeple Keepers, who are responsible for carrying out the activities described here. Their role, appointment and experience levels are described here. We also provide a guide to finding your way around the whole document.\nThe Steeple Keeper # There are many different sorts of bell installations and many different types of Steeple Keeper. We will need to generalise: please use common sense where necessary to refer our words to your own case. Role # A Steeple Keeper (there may be alternative names) is someone who has been appointed to maintain a bell installation in a safe and effective working condition. The ways in which an appointment may be made are covered in Formal Requirements.\nThe role involves regular checks, responding to incidents, carrying out maintenance within the level of their experience, and referring problems to specialists (usually Bell Hangers) where necessary.\nExperience levels # This document is NOT intended to provide a qualification system for Steeple Keepers. Rather, we adopt the descriptive terms defined below in bold:\nA Novice Steeple Keeper is one learning the task. We hope this document will be helpful, but the main instruction will come from local experts, both in formal courses and one-to-one practical demonstrations, supported by wider reading and other information, often backed by technical and engineering knowledge and experience. A Typical Steeple Keeper will have carried out all the routine tasks relevant to their own tower under supervision and will then be capable of carrying them out without supervision; most importantly, they will be capable of recognising cases where they do need to seek guidance. Most Steeple Keepers will fall into this category. An Experienced Steeple Keeper will have experience of a wide range of installations and their potential problems (although they will never make the mistake of thinking they know it all). They will play a role in the task of aiding others in the transition from Novice to Typical Steeple Keeper. In some cases, we will identify tasks which must be carried out by a Specialist, often a Bell Hanger. The fittings and materials of a bell installation may not be familiar to a standard engineering contractor and care must be taken in selecting any other than a specialist Bell Hanger.\nIn this document, we are using the term ‘Bell Hanger’, be they an individual or a company, as having experience in bell installations and meeting the regulatory and insurance requirements to carry out this work. Finding Your Way Round this Document # Links to chapters are in the left-hand side navigation bar and links to sections within each chapter are in the right-hand navigation bar. If you are using a small screen you may need to click on the menu bars (three stacked horizontal lines) in the top left or right to access these menus.\nWithin the text, links to sections within the current chapter, to other chapters, and to external web references are shown in blue. Links shown in bold italic blue refer to entries in the \u0026lsquo;Glossary\u0026rsquo; chapter.\nEach chapter covers a major component part of a bell installation. The following points should be noted:\nThese are not intended as a complete historical description of the component. They provide enough background for the reader to recognise which of the many types of installation they may encounter and the problems which may occur. The basic checks which need to be carried out are described. The maintenance which a Typical Steeple Keeper can carry out is described, and activities that must be referred to a Specialist (usually a professional Bell Hanger) are clearly identified. Some chapters are common to all components of an installation. Please read them: they are important and some have legal implications. They are:\nFormal Requirements covers the need for ringers to recognise the authority responsible for the tower and its fittings, and the need to establish a good working relationship with them. Relevant regulations are described and outline descriptions are given of differences in jurisdictions other than the Church of England. Faculty Jurisdiction Rules covers the legally based rules which apply within Church of England jurisdiction, with specific guidance on those most relevant to ringers. Health \u0026amp; Safety provides guidance on the practical application of Health \u0026amp; Safety principles within the bell chamber. If You Are Just Starting Out # It may be that you have just ‘inherited’ a new tower – perhaps one where there has been no checking or maintenance for a number of years. Where do you start? For either a Novice or a Typical Steeple Keeper, we strongly recommend that you initiate a full inspection by an expert – ideally a Bell Hanger. This will provide a baseline for drawing up a schedule for your own regular checking and maintenance (see Maintenance Schedule).\nImage Credits # Figure Details Title Picture Hawkesbury, Gloucestershire, new ring of 8 bells, cast by Allanconi in Italy, 2020, installed by Matthew Higby.

There will usually be what we will term an Authorising Body that will have a legal responsibility for the tower and its contents.\nThe Steeple Keeper should be formally appointed by the Authorising Body in a clear, democratic, and traceable way, probably for a defined period of time. Once appointed, the Steeple Keeper should maintain contact with the Authorising Body at frequent intervals. While this applies to all ringers, it is particularly important for the Steeple Keeper because the operation and needs of a bell installation may not be familiar to the average member of an Authorising Body.\nRequirements within the Church of England # Of the over 7000 rings of bells in the world, around 90% are with the jurisdiction of the Church of England (CoE). This document is aimed world-wide, however, and we also provide further information in Other Jurisdictions.\nThe ChurchCare website provides useful general information.\nAuthorising Body # Within the Church of England this role is usually filled by the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council (PCC). The legal ownership of the bells is vested in the Churchwardens. The PCC has a duty for the use, maintenance and insurance of the bells.\nRingers must remember that Churchwardens and PCC members are volunteers, with many responsibilities other than the bells. The Steeple Keeper (and other members of the band) should build up good relations with them. This should involve, at least:\nInforming them of all activities associated with the bell installation. Warning them of any problems with the installation. Involving them in important decisions. Being in a position to discuss any church restoration or alteration projects which may have implications for the bell installation. Useful guidance is here. Faculty Jurisdiction Rules # The Faculty Jurisdiction Rules, discussed in more detail here, cover the permissions required to carry out changes to a church. They are legal requirements, and the Church Wardens and PCC members are liable for action if they are not followed. Any changes to the bell installation must be discussed with the Church Wardens and PCC to establish what action may be needed under the Faculty Jurisdiction Rules.\nEcclesiastical Exemption # A Steeple Keeper is unlikely to be involved in the workings of the Ecclesiastical Exemption, but it is worth understanding the principle, as this drives the need for the Faculty Jurisdiction Rules.\nThe Ecclesiastical Exemption provides a mechanism for certain denominations to be exempted from the listed building consent systems administered by local planning authorities. In July 2010, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport issued revised Guidance on the Order covering the operation of the Ecclesiastical Exemption for places of worship in England. This is relevant to bell installations within the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in England.\nQuoting the Guidance: “The 2010 Order limits the Ecclesiastical Exemption to certain buildings within the care of specified denominations which have demonstrated that they operate acceptable internal procedures for dealing with proposed works to listed ecclesiastical buildings …”. The Faculty Jurisdiction Rules are the “acceptable internal procedures” for the Church of England. Arrangements for the other jurisdictions are covered in Other Jurisdictions.\nArchaeologically significant sites # When repairs or alterations to or in historic churches and/or churchyards are under consideration the potential for archaeological implications should always be borne in mind. A guide to church building works with archaeological implications is available here. For a bell installation, the most likely case would be the removal or modification of a historic bell frame. For this, the Church would need to produce a Statement of Significance and the Steeple Keeper would need to contribute their knowledge and experience to this.\nProtected wildlife # For a church tower, bats are the most likely case of protected wildlife – and this is a case where the Steeple Keeper may be the first to detect a possible problem. The Bat Conservation Trust provides useful information here. There may also be restrictions on certain species of birds when nesting.\nOther Jurisdictions # Differences between national laws (even within the devolved parts of the United Kingdom) and between various religious denominations complicate any simple guidance. The following sections provide an initial and incomplete summary which we hope to extend and refine.\nChurches Conservation Trust (CCT) # The online Edition of Dove’s Guide (as of 29 May 2022) records an overall total of 119 full circle rings of 3 or more bells in the care of the CCT, of which 69 are considered to be in a ringable condition. The Trust is striving to put their churches back at the hearts of the communities in which they stand. To this end, they are very encouraging for any groups to use them, and that includes bell ringing.\nCCT churches do not require a faculty in the same way as the Church of England; permission is obtained from the CCT area management. The CCT does not benefit from the Ecclesiastical Exemption, so major work will require listed building consent as appropriate. There may be differences in the approach of various CCT Regions but the general advice is to remain on good terms with the local and Area CCT staff.\nEnglish Cathedrals # Within the CoE jurisdiction, the legal process for cathedrals run parallel with parish church legislation passed by Synod via the Church Commissioners and Parliament. The Ecclesiastical Exemption covers all CoE buildings, fixtures and fittings. The amenity groups have a statutory right to be consulted.\nFor Cathedrals the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England (CFCE) is the equivalent of the Church Buildings Council (CBC). There is more Government and amenity group involvement in the CFCE committees. Each of the cathedrals has its own Fabric Advisory Committee (FAC). This equates to each cathedral having its own Diocesan Advisory Committee. All the cathedrals and churches committees sit within the CBC.\nIreland # In the Church of Ireland (which includes churches in Northern Ireland), applications up to a specified amount are made through the incumbent and the Select Vestry (the equivalent of the PCC in England) to the appropriate Diocesan Council. Financial limits vary (in the Diocese of Limerick for example the limit is €10,000). For major works, applicants visit the Church of Ireland website and download the P5 form, which is self-explanatory.\nThe three RC churches in Ireland that have bells (Mount St Alphonsus, SS Augustine \u0026amp; John and Rowe Street) all come under different jurisdictions. Mount St Alphonsus \u0026ldquo;belongs to the Redemptorists and decisions regarding infrastructure would be made by our provincial council in consultation with the Rector of Mount St Alphonsus and with the advice of our buildings officer\u0026rdquo;. John\u0026rsquo;s Lane is an Augustinian church so it would be appropriate to apply through their priest to their Order. Rowe Street Wexford would follow the same procedure as the RC churches in England.\nThere is no Ecclesiastical Exemption in the Republic of Ireland. Bodies responsible for a place of worship included on the list of protected structures are required to gain agreement from the local authority for any works of alteration – both inside and out.\nFor Northern Island, a consultation on Ecclesiastical Exemption held in 2016 included views that the Exemption should be abandoned, as for the Republic. However, the Minister for Communities concluded that the Ecclesiastical Exemption should continue.\nIsle of Man # Although the Isle of Man is part of the Church of England (indeed the oldest established diocese in the CoE), and comes under the Archdiocese of York, it is not subject to UK domestic law. Hence, the UK Faculty Jurisdiction Rules and all other UK church law do not apply to the Isle of Man. However, the Faculty Jurisdiction Rules are copied into Manx Law with some minor differences.\nA fundamental difference is that the Ecclesiastical Exemption does not apply in the Isle of Man. For faculty applications that need civil planning approval, this must be obtained before any formal faculty application is made.\nScotland # Guidance (pdf download) is available on the operation of the Ecclesiastical Exemption in Scotland.\nWales # The Faculty Procedure in the Church of Wales (CoW) is similar but not identical to that in the Church of England (CoE). For example, the CoE allow more works under their Lists A and B items than the CoW. The CoE also allow Archdeacons to approve List B items, while approval of the Diocesan Registrar is required in the CoW.\nA Faculty is required for works outside lists A and B. This needs to be approved by a Diocesan Chancellor (normally a secular judge) before the works can proceed.\nUnlike the Church of England, the Church in Wales owns its churches which are essentially held in trust (formally called the Representative Body of the Church in Wales).\nFollowing a consultation in 2018, Ecclesiastical Exemption broadly similar to that in the Church of England has been implemented in Wales.\nOutside the British Isles # We do not yet have information from ANZAB, NAG or other towers outside the British Isles. This will be included as it becomes available.\nDisclaimer # Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, neither contributors nor the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers can accept responsibility for any inaccuracies or for any activities undertaken based on the information provided.\nVersion 0.1 (pre-publication), May 2022\n© 2022 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/030-faculty-rules/","title":"Faculty Jurisdiction Rules","section":"Docs","content":" Faculty Jurisdiction Rules # This chapter refers to activities carried out in churches within the jurisdiction of the Church of England. Ringers must remember that the Rules are set out in law, with possible penalties if they are not followed. Meeting the Rules is the responsibility of the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council, and ringers must use their specialist knowledge to assist the Church authorities in any application. Guidance should be sought from the Diocesan Secretary, The Diocesan Bell Advisor, and the local Guild or Association. Ringers are probably aware that a Faculty may be required prior to work being done in a Church of England Church. The faculty process exempts churches from listed building consent and conservation area consent that could apply elsewhere. When alterations are proposed, the parish must present the proposals to the archdeacon. For minor alterations, the archdeacon may authorise the work but more major projects will be judged by the Chancellor of the diocese, taking advice from specialists in the Diocesan Advisory Committee. The faculty is the legal authorisation of the work by the Chancellor.\nThe faculty system is a judicial system, so these notes reflect this style. Parishes and ringers intending do any work in their tower or on their bells must consider the full implications of the Rules.\nBackground # The Faculty Jurisdiction Rules 2015 were introduced with the intention of simplifying the faculty process and reducing the burden of administration, in particular for churchwardens and others in parishes with responsibility for church buildings. The major innovation of the 2015 Rules was the introduction of Lists A and B for items that could be undertaken without a faculty, subject to some general conditions stipulated in the Schedule.\nItems in List A may be undertaken by a parish without a faculty and without the need for any form of consultation. Items in List B may be undertaken without a faculty provided the archdeacon is consulted and has given written authorisation. The Rules were amended in 2019 and again in 2022. The latest guidance is here.\nItems Most Likely to be of Relevance for Ringers # The extracts given below are relevant to bells and associated fittings, and also to clocks. Church clocks are included here because they are typically housed in the church tower and in many cases use the ringing bells as clock bells.\nList A: # As stated above, items in List A may simply be undertaken (within the specified conditions) by a parish without a faculty and without the need for any form of consultation. The Steeple Keeper will work closely with the parish in discussions on these.\nA3.

This chapter covers the specific aspects of H\u0026amp;S when carrying out routine checks and basic maintenance in the bell chamber, in any tower.\nNote that there will be an Authorising Body for work carried out in a tower. Within the Church of England this will be the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council; different arrangements may apply in other jurisdictions – see Formal Requirements. Members of this body may not be familiar with aspects of working on bell installations and the ringers must explain and agree their methods of working. Note that this does not detract from the ringers’ own responsibility for safe working. There is a range of legal requirements must be followed and guidance from the UK Health \u0026amp; Safety Executive is available here. While many of these requirements are written as if only for those in employment, most also apply to volunteers. We identify here general rules intended to help identify potential hazards and to reduce risks to those involved. We recognise that an appropriate balance must be achieved between making the activity achievable while reducing the level of risk to that which is as low as reasonably possible.\nTopics Relevant to Work in the Bell Chamber # Protecting workers in the bell chamber # Accidental or malicious interference with the bell ropes may present a hazard when work is being carried out in the bell chamber. The extent of risk depends on the accessibility of the ringing room – this is a particular problem for ground-floor rings. Possible solutions are:\nMaking sure that someone is present in the ringing room. This may not be possible unless routine checks and maintenance are being carried out on the same day as general tower housekeeping. Your expected time of completion is known by others and that they check that you return on schedule. Warning notices – an example is shown in the Title Figure (but do not rely on this alone). Hoisting the ropes on a spider. For ground-floor or otherwise accessible ringing rooms this may require a locking system for the spider. Hoisting the ropes up into a secure intermediate room, or even into the bell chamber. Consider security of the building while working upstairs – an open church and tower would enable unauthorised access and could pose risks to those working upstairs. A secured building could prevent access by help in an emergency. Could people upstairs be locked in accidentally by a well-meaning person who was unaware? Arrangements will have to be considered for the building in question: other users, access routes, key holders etc. Working conditions # Bell chambers present significant hazards when moving around. The following points should be noted:\nWhere possible, maintain three points of contact when making a move. Test any footholds before applying weight. Beware of damaged or rotten floorboards. Do not try to carry large and / or heavy items: Pull bags of tools, etc, up by rope rather than carrying them up ladders. Where possible, have assistants to pass items safely. Remember that bells, wheels and ropes will move if force is applied. Be aware of heavy weights. For example, be prepared to take a significant weight if you are supporting a clapper which is about to be removed. Some people may wish to bring a radio or listen to music or other media while working in a tower. This is not recommended (whether with headphones or stand-alone equipment) as people should be able to communicate with each other clearly, particularly if an emergency should arise. Ladders and working at heights # Very few towers were constructed with the working platforms, ladders and guard rails that would be built into a newly designed and constructed building. Not all tower staircases even have handrails. Anyone working in a tower must therefore consider how they will access and manoeuvre in and around the bell frame and installation. Remember that some timber - whether ladders, flooring, or other planks and boarding - may be rotten or decayed so not strong enough to take the weight of one or more people perhaps also with the additional weight of heavy items such as a clapper.\nHazardous materials # Where chemicals are used, the container must be checked for health warnings. For example, white spirit has traditionally been used for cleaning oil and grease spills. But white spirit is harmful to skin and the lungs, and is difficult to dispose of safely. Fortunately, safer materials with low volatile organic compounds (VOC) are now available and should be used instead.\nIf any repainting involves removal of old paint, be aware that this may contain lead. Get advice from an expert.\nAfter work is complete, any paints, chemicals and cleaning products, as well as brushes and rags used to apply them, must be removed from the tower. They should be stored if likely to be reused in appropriate clean dry conditions according to the manufacturers’ instructions, with empty containers and rubbish disposed of safely.\nBird or bat droppings can carry infections such as psittacosis from birds. If extensive, a specialist should be employed for cleaning.\nAlthough less likely in a church tower, there may be old asbestos boarding or lagging in towers. As a hint, if plumbing is or has been installed - for example water tanks and pipework - this may well have been lagged with materials that are now recognised as hazardous.\nPersonal protective equipment # Suitable personal protective equipment should be worn when working in the bell chamber:\nA boiler suit or, more often nowadays, reinforced workwear. Non-slip safety boots, with steel toecaps and good ankle support. Protective gloves suitable for the task undertaken. Face mask and eye protection, especially for when sanding or creating dust, cleaning up dust and debris, or drilling above head height. If work is being carried out at various levels, a hard hat should be worn to protect against falling objects; for working under bells a bump cap may be preferable (although this will not protect against falling objects). Examples of gloves, hard hat and bump cap, and safety boots are shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Typical personal protective equipment\nFire protection # Naked flames and other heat sources should never be used in a tower; smoking is forbidden! Also remember that, when cutting or drilling, swarf and the hole being created may become hot. Swarf may even be hot enough to start a fire if it builds up in contact with other flammable substances.\nWorking alone # In general, you should NOT work alone in a bell chamber. The only possible relaxation is if someone else is in the tower and in contact with you: the most likely case is when you are fitting a new rope and the helper is in the ringing room holding the bottom end at the correct height.\nBell chambers offer many opportunities for slips, trips and falls. If one of those led to injury when working alone, how would you summon help? You might have a mobile phone – but that could be damaged or you might be unconscious. Will there even be a reliable signal and do you know who to call in an emergency? You might have told someone what you were doing – but how long would it take them to realise what had happened?\nMoving bells # It may be necessary to swing a bell through a small angle – for example, to listen for noise in the bearings. Remember that it is difficult, even impossible, to stop a moving bell. So be very careful where you place head, hands and feet when a bell is moving, even by a small amount. Make sure that co-workers are aware when a bell is to be moved by someone else.\nCan you work on bells when ‘up’? # In general, you should NOT carry out work in the bell chamber when any bell is ‘up’. Even moving past an ‘up’ bell to reach one that is ‘down’ may pose unacceptable risks.\nThe only likely relaxation is where it is necessary to observe a bell while a second person is ringing it – to check for rope handling problems, for example, or to check if a newly fitted Hastings stay is binding on the quadrant. Based on a risk assessment, the observer MUST position themself out of any danger (including consideration of the possibility of ejection of a broken clapper) and MUST wear ear protection. Most importantly, the observer MUST be able to contact the ringer immediately in case of any problem. Ideally another person should be present in the bell chamber, again well out of the way of danger.\nLighting and electrical equipment # A good starting point is for the bell chamber to be well lit with professionally installed lighting. But that is not always available and, in any case, additional lighting may be needed: for example, when working under the bells. In the past, this usually required inspection lamps with trailing mains cables. But the availability of bright, portable, battery powered LED lights removes the risks of tripping and electrocution posed by mains lighting. An LED head torch is invaluable, especially when working in cramped conditions. Examples of an LED head torch and portable light are shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: Examples of portable LED lights\nIf there is no natural lighting in the bell chamber, then more than one light source should be always on. It is very easy to break a lamp or for batteries to fail, leaving those in the bell chamber in complete darkness. Remember that it may get dark while you are working in the tower later in the afternoon or evening!\nA general rule is that mains power tools with trailing leads should be avoided in the ringing chamber. If it is essential, a risk assessment must be carried out and great care exercised to make sure that the cables do not get damaged or add yet more trip hazards. Remember that portable battery power tools are available for almost all tasks likely to be carried out by a Typical Steeple Keeper.\nUsed of closed-circuit TV # Some churches have installed closed-circuit TV systems allowing a choice of views of (a) the interior of the church (checking for progress of a wedding) and (b) the bell chamber (useful for open day visits). The latter can also be useful in maintaining contact between the ringing room and the bell chamber during maintenance work.\nImage Credits # Figure Details Title Picture Typical warning notice.

The arrangement of the spokes is both traditional and functional, although there may be some variations. A wheel is made in two parts to allow it to be fitted around the headstock. This has the bonus of making it easier to manoeuvre the parts up to the bell chamber.\nNaming of Parts # A typical wheel is constructed from eleven different components, some with different historic names. Figure 1 shows a typical wheel, viewed as it would be seen with the bell ‘down’. The names used in this chapter, with some alternatives in brackets, are identified on Figure 1 as follows:\nFigure 1: Parts of a bell wheel\nA.\tTransom (Long Spoke, Transome, Long Wheel Spoke)\nB.\tMain Spokes (High Rail)\nC.\tTop Spokes (High Spoke)\nD.\tMeeting Spokes (Meeting Rail)\nE.\tBottom Spokes (Leg Spoke)\nF.\tEye Piece\nG.\tHalving Bolts\nH.\tShroud (Cheeks, Shrouding, Rave, Siding)\nThe bell rope enters the wheel through a Garter Hole near the Top Spoke on the ground pulley side of the wheel, the exact location depending on the position of the ground pulley. (Ground Pulleys are discussed in Rope Routes.) This is shown in detail on Figure 2 as follows:\nFigure 2: Details around the garter hole\nA.\tShroud (Cheeks, Shrouding, Rave, Siding)\nB.\tSole (Sole Plate)\nC.\tGarter Hole (Fillet Hole, Gart-hole)\nD.\tWheel Bobbins (Half Bobbins)\nE.\tRope\nConstruction # Traditionally, bell wheels are constructed from three different types of wood. The spokes are made from oak, the sole from ash and the shrouds from elm. Nowadays, however, shrouds are usually made from marine plywood. Shrouds were formally nailed to the sole but there is a tendency for the nails to rust and nowadays small non-ferrous or stainless-steel screws are used. Sections of shrouding are keyed together by a thin piece of wood, termed a ‘Feather’. Historically, iron feathers were used but these are subject to rusting, causing the end of the shrouding to split.\nThe joint between the two parts of the wheel lies between the Transome (A) and the Meeting Spokes (D) with the two parts secured by the Halving Bolts (G) – all shown on Figure 1.\nAs shown on Figure 2, Wheel Bobbins (D) protect the rope from wear as it emerges from the Garter Hole (C). Within the wheel, the rope is tied off around the two Main Spokes (B on Figure 1) – this figure shows how the edges of the spokes may be chamfered to avoid damage to the rope. (The tying off of a rope can just be seen on the bell in the background of Figure 3.) Further information is provided in Ropes and Rope Routes.\nFigure 3: Fastenings to a steel headstock (A), and an angle brace (B)\nA wheel is usually attached to a wooden Headstock by long bolts through the main spokes and the headstock; cast iron or fabricated steel headstocks will usually have provision for a bracket to attach the wheel. An example is shown at (A) on Figure 3. That figure also shows at (B) a steel Angle Brace bolted (it may be screwed) diagonally on the inner face of the wheel to further strengthen the wheel. Wheels fitted to wooden headstocks may have Wheel Stays. These are metal rods fitted between wheel and headstock to brace the wheel (arrowed on Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Wheel stays (arrowed)\nChecks Required # Wheels are not for Climbing On\nWheels are strong in terms of their designed use, but weak if subjected to a sideways force. Never use a wheel as a climbing frame when moving around the bell frame. They are expensive items to replace.\nThe complexity of a wheel and the materials used mean that the amount of maintenance able to be carried out by a Typical Steeple Keeper is limited. But the regular checks described below are essential to spot (and possibly rectify) problems, and to identify problems needing assistance from a Bell Hanger before they become critical.\nWheel not running true # An initial check is to swing the bell (when down) through a small angle. Any obvious sideways movement of the rim of the wheel shows a wheel that is not running true. If this is substantial it could lead to the rope slipping wheel.\nThe cause may be some looseness in the fastenings, or possibly a bent wheel stay. The further checks described here may resolve the problem. If not, this is a job for a Bell Hanger.\nDamage to the wood # Any evidence of rot or beetle attack must be addressed immediately. While there are contractors who provide this service, the use of a Bell Hanger is to be preferred.\nGeneral advice is that wood should be treated with a preservative about every 10 years. Bearing in mind that the wheels need removal to do this thoroughly, the use of a Bell Hanger is preferable. It may be possible to combine this with a major overhaul.\nLoose fastenings # All fastenings on a wheel need to be checked regularly for tightness. This is particularly important for those involving wooden components, which may shrink with variations of temperature and humidity. A Typical Steeple Keeper should be competent to carry out these checks and any required tightening.\nRemember that the most reliable way of checking tightness is to first loosen the nut and then re-tighten. This ensures (a) that the nut is not just rusted in position and (b) that the thread has not bottomed out. Items to be checked are:\nThe halving bolts. These are often coach bolts, with the nuts underneath the transom, and easily missed. The fastenings between wheel and headstock, both on the wheel and headstock sides. Fastenings holding any reinforcing bars strengthening the wheels. For a wooden headstock, fastenings attaching wheel stays, if present. It may be prudent to prepare a check list of all fastenings, to ensure none are missed. Marking checked fastenings with chalk is another possibility.\nWear and damage # Items to be covered here are:\nShroud # Check for any damage. It is not unknown for contractors to cause accidental damage to a shroud while carrying out other work in the tower. If shrouds are nailed to the sole, check for rusting or missing nails. Check for splitting at joints between sections of shroud, possibly resulting from rusting of iron feathers. A skilled woodworker may be able to rectify any problems found but, considering the complexity of a wheel, and the cost of a new one, the Steeple Keeper should consider consulting a Bell Hanger in all but very minor cases of damage.\nSole # The sole is usually secured to the spokes by countersunk screws. These must be checked for tightness. If any part of a screw is proud it will rapidly wear the rope.\nBobbins and garter hole # These are unlikely to cause problems but should be checked to ensure that the rope path is smooth. Careful use of sandpaper should solve any problems.\nWheel stays # Wheel stays, as used to support the wheel with a wooden headstock, are relatively fragile and can easily be bent. In the extreme, this can cause the wheel to run untrue. If necessary, they can be carefully bent back to a straight line. If in doubt, contact a Bell Hanger.\nImage Credits # Figure Details 1 Wheel annotated to show component parts. (Photo: Graham Clifton, Whites of Appleton) 2 Details of garter hole and bobbins.

This has a low carbon content with slag inclusions which form a fibrous structure as the material is forged (or \u0026lsquo;wrought\u0026rsquo;) into a finished product. This material is tough, malleable, ductile, corrosion resistant and easily forge welded. It is an ideal material for producing a clapper. Unfortunately, it is now difficult to source. Faced with the difficulty of obtaining wrought iron, ductile iron, also known as spheroidal graphitic (or \u0026lsquo;SG\u0026rsquo;) cast iron, became the material of use for clappers. This is iron containing a high level of carbon (around 3%). Unlike the more familiar form of cast iron, where the carbon forms inclusions in the shape of flakes, ductile iron includes alloying elements which result in the carbon forming nodular inclusions, giving a tougher material. Being cast, rather than forged, the shape of the casting pattern is important. Some early SG clappers had oversized shafts, balls and flights which could lead to handling and striking problems, as well as possible damage to the bell. It is possible to machine such clappers to a better profile but this must be done by a specialist. Steel clappers have been made but are not widely used. Since 2005, an increasing number of bells are fitted with wooden shafted clappers. If well designed, these may improve the handling of \u0026lsquo;awkward\u0026rsquo; bells and make it easier to raise large bells \u0026lsquo;right\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; see Wooden Shafted Clappers. \u0026lsquo;Composite clappers\u0026rsquo; are also available: these use a man-made material for the shaft. Clapper suspension \u0026ndash; historical # This section describes historical clapper designs to allow a Steeple Keeper to recognise them. The maintenance and repair of such clappers is a specialist task and advice should be sought from a bell hanger. Up until the mid-19th century, clappers were suspended from a U-shaped wrought iron staple, cast into the crown of a bell during its manufacture. Iron corrodes with time and the corroded staple expands in the crown of the bell, generating stresses which will ultimately lead to cracking of the bell. For this reason, cast-in crown staples must be removed if the bell is to be retained for ringing \u0026ndash; see Removal of a cast-in crown staple.\nThe clapper was usually suspended from a cast-in crown staple using a baldric (or \u0026lsquo;baldrick\u0026rsquo;). In the nineteenth century, in the absence (or after the removal) of a cast-in crown staple, a separate \u0026lsquo;centre bolt\u0026rsquo; would be passed up through the crown of the bell and headstock. The traditional suspension would be made from a stirrup at the bottom of this bolt, with a baldrick or using a wooden block arrangement \u0026ndash; for example, the \u0026lsquo;Rudhall wooden top\u0026rsquo; shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Wrought iron clapper with Rudhall wooden top\nModern independent clapper assemblies # In modern installations, the clapper is suspended from an independent crown staple, with a centre bolt passing up through the crown of the bell and the headstock. The component parts, shown in Figure 2, are:\nFigure 2: Parts of an independent crown staple\nA fixing nut at the top of the headstock. There are several possibilities for this: The most common is a castellated nut held in place with a split pin, shown in Figure 2(b). Stainless steel split pins are preferred to avoid corrosion and they may need to be replaced after removal. A plain nut with a split pin above \u0026ndash; the nut may work loose but should not come off completely. A nut plus a locknut, shown at (A) on Figure 2(a). A nut with a sacrificial plastic insert \u0026ndash; this type must be replaced every time the nut is removed. Proprietary locking nuts with a metallic spring section that clamps to the thread. A steel washer between the nut and the top of the headstock (not included on Figure 2(a) but visible on Figure 2(b)). The part of the centre bolt within the headstock is often of square section. Under the crown of the bell is the crown staple washer, made of leather or fibre, (B) on Figure 2(a). When the centre bolt nut is tightened, this helps to lock the crown staple in position within the bell. This is particularly important where the inside of the crown of the bell is rough \u0026ndash; for example where the bell has been quarter turned. At the bottom of the crown staple is usually a clevis fitting, (C) on Figure 2(a), comprising a U-shaped yoke with a pivot pin supporting the clapper \u0026ndash; described in the following section. Pivot pin and clapper bushes # Some designs of wooden shafted clappers have a ball bearing suspension. This is outside the scope of this document. The U-shaped clevis has two holes to accommodate a pivot pin. Usually, one hole and one end of the pin are threaded. After insertion, the threaded end of the pin protrudes through the clevis and is secured by a locknut \u0026ndash; shown at (D) on Figure 2(a). The other end of the pin has a bolt head or machined flats to allow a spanner to hold the pin while the locknut is tightened. If a bolt head is present, care must be taken not to overtighten as this could crack a cast staple or bend a steel one.\nThe top end of the clapper has a hole through which the pivot pin passes, fitted with a replaceable bush. Various types of bushes may be encountered:\nTraditionally, clapper bushes were made of lignum vitae. This is a dense wood (it sinks in water) containing oils which provide some natural lubrication. It is ideal as a bearing material and has been used for bearings in hydro-electric plants and nuclear submarines. Unfortunately, the source trees are now regarded as \u0026lsquo;Near Threatened\u0026rsquo; making further use of this material unsustainable. If worn lignum vitae bushes are encountered, they must be replaced \u0026ndash; this is outside the scope of this document.\nClapper bushes made from lignum vitae require additional lubrication, either by a screw cap lubricator of the \u0026lsquo;Stauffer\u0026rsquo; type or a grease nipple. Although more modern types of metal or plastic bushes may require no lubrication some bell hangers still provide grease nipples or similar, as shown at (E) on Figure 2(a). On balance, a method of lubrication is preferred although the benefit of retrospective fitting may be small.\nModern types of clapper bush are made of:\nOil impregnated sintered phosphor bronze. Nylon. Experience with a problem of swelling when damp or at elevated temperature means such bushes are now rarely fitted. Existing nylon bushes need not be replaced if performing satisfactorily. If necessary, the swelling problem can be rectified by careful reaming. TUFNOL. This is a proprietary laminated material impregnated with phenolic resin. Bushes may be backed by a layer of rubber.\nClapper centring pins # Figure 3: Twiddle pin (A), and double crown staple locknut (B)\nWhile not strictly part of the clapper, it is appropriate to mention these here.\nMost modern rings of bells with cast iron or fabricated steel headstocks have clapper centring pins fitted \u0026ndash; usually known as \u0026lsquo;Twiddle Pins\u0026rsquo;. There is clearance where the crown staple passes through the bottom of the headstock and the crown of the bell: twiddle pins allow the crown staple to be positioned in the centre of the bell. There is a twiddle pin on either side of the headstock, one of which can be seen at (A) on Figure 3. Each pin comprises a machine screw which locates against the generally square section of the centre bolt. The crown staple can be positioned by slackening one pin and tightening the other. Locknuts on each pin allow the pins to be locked in place when the process is complete. (Figure 3 also shows (B) another example of double locknuts on the crown staple.)\nThe use of twiddle pins to correct an odd-struck bell is described in Odd-Struck Bells.\nChecking Clappers # This Section deals with initial and regular checks of clappers. Routine checks and maintenance should be carried out in accordance with a schedule - see Maintenance Schedule - and results of all checks, including issues raised and how they were resolved, should be recorded.\nFor both practical and safety reasons, the checking and any subsequent maintenance must be carried out by at least two people, taking account of Health \u0026amp; Safety Requirements. The checks described here can be carried out by a Typical Steeple Keeper and helpers on the more modern independent crown staple designs; checks on the older types of clapper suspension may require assistance from more experienced personnel.\nThe procedure for checking is as follows:\nFigure 4: Wooden shafted clapper - note bolts securing ball to shaft\nProcedure for checking a clapper\nStanding in the pit, swing the clapper to check for squealing or grinding noises. It should swing smoothly and noiselessly. If not, this could indicate problems with the clapper bush. If the clapper has provision for lubrication this should be used.\nCheck the clapper is swinging \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; that is, the axes of rotation of the bell and the clapper are parallel. This can be checked by loosely holding the clapper vertical while a helper swings the bell through a small angle. If the clapper is not true it will move slightly sideways as the bell swings. Correction of this problem is described in Clapper not swinging true.\nIf this is a first check, assess the extent of the clapper impact area on the inside of the bell. If elongated this indicates wear of the clapper bush.\nIf the bell has a wooden clapper, this is a good time to check the tightness of the bolts securing the shaft to the clapper ball (see Figure 4) and the top fitting. For all clapper types, also check the locknut on the pivot pin. These fittings are subject to vibration, especially if the bush is worn, and it is not unknown for the pivot pin to work its way out and lead to ejection of the clapper. The consequences of this are similar to those of a broken clapper.\nCheck the movement of the clapper by attempting to lift the clapper vertically while a helper holds the crown staple nut lightly (if twiddle pins are present, slacken one of them first). On a well-maintained bell, there should be no vertical movement of the crown staple nut. When finished, remember to re-tighten the twiddle pin.\nThere are two main reasons why movement might occur:\nThe nut may have worked loose. This is unlikely with a castellated nut and split pin or a proprietary type of locknut but might occur with other types of nuts. The corrective action is described in Correcting loose crown staple nut.\nThe crown staple washer may be damaged or have become compressed.\nWith the crown staple tight on the crown of the bell, there may still be some small vertical movement arising from play in the clapper bush. This can be investigated further by the sideways movement of the clapper \u0026ndash; sometimes termed \u0026ldquo;clapper roll\u0026rdquo;. This is a sensitive measurement as a small movement in the bush is magnified by the length of the clapper. Clapper roll is measured most easily by standing in front of the bell with the clapper pulled to touch the rim. The total extent (left to right) of sideways movement can then be measured. The amount of roll should be checked and recorded on each occasion to provide a history of bush wear and to give warning of the need for re-bushing. As a guide, clapper roll over 20mm is warning of a need to plan for re-bushing and over 50mm requires immediate attention. A sudden large increase in clapper roll may indicate breakage of the pivot pin.\nIf the bells have not been inspected for a long time, wear of the bush will also be revealed by an elongated impact area on the bell. It will be necessary to remove the clapper to investigate (a) noise from the swinging clapper, (b) excessive clapper roll, or (c) possible damage to the crown staple washer or pivot pin \u0026ndash; clapper removal is described in Removal and replacement of a clapper.\nMaintenance # Removal of a cast-in crown staple # Removal of a cast-in crown staple must be carried out by a professional Bell Hanger, commonly within their workshop. Note that this work will require a faculty.\nClapper not swinging true # When working under small bells it may be necessary to remove the slider (if present) to provide better access. You MUST check it has been replaced correctly when the work is complete. Correction of a clapper which is not swinging true is within the capability of a Typical Steeple Keeper.\nProcedure for correcting a clapper not swinging true\nSlacken off one twiddle pin if present. Helper just slackens the crown staple nut. Steeple Keeper loosely holds the clapper vertical and checks for sideways movement as the helper swings the bell through a small angle. The Steeple Keeper twists the clapper to correct the swing and repeats step 3 until satisfied that the clapper is swinging true. Steeple Keeper holds the clapper in the correct position against the edge of the bell while the helper tightens the crown staple nut and, if fitted, the twiddle pin. Repeat step 3 to check that the clapper is still swinging true \u0026ndash; over-enthusiastic re-tightening of the crown staple nut may rotate the crown staple. Record a note to repeat the check at the next maintenance session. The clapper will need removal for further investigation if the problem recurs.\nCorrecting loose crown staple nut # As in replacement of the clapper described below.\nRemoval and replacement of a clapper # Using local effort to remove and replace a clapper is valuable, since it saves a bell hanger the time and expense of travel to do this small part of the work. Removal and replacement of a clapper is within the capability of a Typical Steeple Keeper, even if rectification of any problems requires specialist services.\nProcedure for removal of a clapper\nRemove the split pin if present. Slightly loosen the crown staple nut, ideally using the correct size spanner, although a large adjustable spanner is a possible alternative. This may require some effort. If twiddle pins are present, slacken one. Alternatively, slacken both by the same number of turns. Using tape or a marker pen, mark the ground pulley side of the clapper and the crown staple. This is to ensure that the clapper is replaced in the original orientation. A helper stands in the pit ready to support the clapper while the Steeple Keeper removes the crown staple nut. The Steeple Keeper must warn the helper just before the nut comes off the thread. The nut and washer are replaced for safe keeping on the crown staple after removal. With the assembly removed, any problems with a worn bush, failure of a pivot pin or a damaged crown staple washer will usually be obvious. Any problems can be rectified either by a local engineering specialist or a Bell Hanger. If this involves disassembly of the clapper, the contractor must be required to replace it in the original orientation, using the marks made on the clapper and crown staple in item 3 above.\nNote that the traditional leather or fibre washers may compress gradually and be more easily damaged by movement. Harder materials are available and advice on this should be sought from a Bell Hanger.\nReplacement of the clapper follows the reverse procedure, ensuring that:\nThe clapper is replaced in the original orientation and is swinging true \u0026ndash; see Clapper not swinging true. The twiddle pin or pins, if present, is/are tightened. This is done with the crown staple nut just tight (\u0026ldquo;nipped up\u0026rdquo; seems to be the technical term). The crown staple nut is tightened. A rule of thumb is to use reasonable force applied to a 10 inch (25cm) spanner. A final check is carried out to ensure the clapper is swinging true. The precautions described above to replace the clapper in the same orientation should ensure that the clapper will not become odd-struck (assuming it was not originally odd-struck). If the clapper has not been marked or reassembled incorrectly it will be necessary to check the odd-struckness and correct as necessary \u0026ndash; see Odd-Struck Bells. Finally, details of the work carried out are recorded for future reference.\nOther Information # Odd-struck bells # Ideally, the time it takes for a bell to strike after being pulled off at handstroke should be equal to the time at backstroke. Many ringers will have visited towers where they are warned that a certain bell is \u0026ldquo;a bit slow at handstroke\u0026rdquo; or something similar. But this should not be the case for a modern bell with the clapper hanging in the centre of the bell at rest.\nWe are assuming here that all the checks and maintenance described above have been carried out. This should have eliminated problems caused by clappers not running freely, worn bushes, loose crown staples and so on. All of these could result in unpredictable odd-struckness. But, as a responsible Steeple Keeper, you will have already ruled out all of these. A bell that is noticeably odd-struck and has twiddle pins can be corrected as follows:\nProcedure for correcting odd-struckness\nWith the bell down, pull up the rope and secure it to take the weight of the rope off the wheel. The bell should now be at bottom dead centre of its rotation. If possible, check this with a straight edge and a spirit level across the mouth of the bell. (A bell on plain bearings may need nudging for it to settle at bottom dead centre.) Slightly loosen the crown staple nut. Standing facing the bell, touch the end of a tape measure against the striking surface on the clapper ball (taking care not to move the clapper) and read the measurement to the lip of the bell. Repeat this on the opposite side (it helps to have one person on each side). If the readings are different, slacken one twiddle pin and tighten the other. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the two measurements are equal, ideally to within 1mm. Re-tighten the crown staple nut and twiddle pins, and re-instate the bell rope. If twiddle pins are not present, the recommendation is to place a tapered washer (or a half-washer) under the crown of the bell. Advice on this should be sought from a specialist.\nElectronic devices are available for measuring odd-struckness \u0026ndash; as described in Odd-struckness and swing periods. It may be possible to find someone able to offer this as a service \u0026ndash; perhaps in your local Guild or Association. Such a device can also offer useful data on the swing periods of bells and the comparison between all bells in the ring \u0026ndash; see also in Odd-struckness and swing periods. While outside the scope of this document, this may be worth investigating as a way of dealing with problems in striking for some rings of bells.\nClapper breakage # Figure 5: SG cast iron clapper broken at the top end\nThe consequences of a broken clapper (Figure 5) can be serious, with the flying clapper causing expensive damage - maybe even breaking another bell.\nIn the event of breakage, the steeple keeper must check all parts of the installation for any consequential damage. Failures such as that shown in Figure 5 usually occur in SG clappers and result from a fatigue crack initiated from a pre-existing defect, leading to failure when the crack reaches a critical size. This type of crack is almost impossible to detect before failure without the use of specialised equipment and certainly not with the clapper in place within the bell.\nBroken clappers, either SG or wrought iron, cannot be repaired by electric welding. For an SG clapper, the answer is a new clapper. Wrought iron clappers can be repaired by forge welding \u0026ndash; in fact, many wrought iron clappers are made in two parts which are then forge welded to the correct length. But this work must be carried out by a specialist.\nAnother possible cause of clapper failure is the pivot pin working loose and eventually falling out. This is something which should be detectable at an early stage and rectified during regular checks. In summary, any repairs or replacements for clappers must be carried out by a Bell Hanger. A Typical Steeple Keeper can play a part by removing the remains of the clapper and by installing the new or repaired one.\nWorn clapper ball # Wear on the striking face of the clapper ball should be checked during routine maintenance. If a substantial flat surface has developed this is a job for a Bell Hanger, although the Steeple Keeper can assist by removing and replacing the clapper. The Bell Hanger may be able to twist and re-forge the shaft of a wrought iron clapper to present a new striking face.\nBell going up wrong # Some bells, particularly those over 20 to 25 cwt, are prone to going up \u0026lsquo;wrong\u0026rsquo;. That is, the clapper is on the higher (wrong) side of the bell when it is set at handstroke after raising. For some bells, it may be difficult to set the bell when this occurs. This depends on the design of bell and clapper \u0026ndash; more specifically, on (a) the distance between the two axes of rotation of bell and clapper, and (b) the low amplitude swing periods of the bell and clapper. As a rough guide, the low amplitude swing period of the clapper should be at least 90% that of the bell.\nRectification is a job for specialists. Replacement with a wooden shafted clapper may help.\nFurther Reading # Wooden shafted clappers # Bernard Taylor provides a history of the development of wooden shafted clappers in: \u0026ldquo;Wheeler\u0026rsquo;s Wooden Wallopers\u0026rdquo;.

You may encounter the two types of bearing – plain bearings and ball bearings. We will describe both, but a Typical Steeple Keeper’s main task will be the important role of carrying out the checks described here. This will help identify any problems before they reach a critical stage.\nA Typical Steeple Keeper can only carry out basic maintenance on bearings: for example, lubrication of plain bearings. Major jobs will usually require the lifting of a bell, even by a small amount, and this is a job for Bell Hangers, who carry the necessary insurances and requirements of Health \u0026amp; Safety regulations. Also, within the jurisdiction of the Church of England, there will be a legal requirement to obtain a faculty for such work. Further details are given in Formal Requirements, Faculty Jurisdiction Rules and Health \u0026amp; Safety. Ball Bearings # Description # Ball bearings started to be fitted to bells only in the early 1920s but their use since then is almost universal, so these are the ones you are most likely to experience.\nFigure 1: Ball bearing - the split for assembly is arrowed\nA ball bearing (Figure 1) is a sealed unit that should require no regular maintenance. The bearing consists of one (or possibly two) rings of hardened steel balls running between two hardened steel tracks. The inner ring is mounted on the gudgeon and the outer on the bearing housing, mounted on the frame. On assembly, the bearings are filled with grease which is retained by seals. The grease provides some lubrication to prevent fretting between the balls and the track, but its main use is to protect the components from rusting.\nDesigns vary, but the type of bearing shown in Figure 1 is split for assembly along the line arrowed. Do not try to separate the two halves during routine checks.\nThe ball bearings used for bell hanging are self-aligning, allowing for small movements of the bell frame – particularly important for wooden frames. Lateral movement, resulting from small movements between the two side frames, is accommodated by a small amount of lateral travel (often termed ‘end float’) on one bearing, usually the one on the wheel side.\nIn many engineering applications, ball bearings provide prolonged satisfactory operation. But the alternating direction of rotation of the bell when ringing is not ideal, and neither are impacts on the bell from clock or chiming hammers. Impacts from chiming hammers is particularly harmful, as the film of grease may not be replenished when the bell is stationary, leading to metal-to-metal contact between the balls and the track.\nRegular checks and maintenance # Unless you suspect a problem with ball bearings (see Problems with Bearings), the only checks you should undertake are:\nCheck the tightness of the bolts holding the bearing to the frame. Check for leakage of grease from the end seals. Check clearances at either side – a bell can ‘travel’ sideways slightly, especially when subjected to a heavy clock hammer. This is unusual but should be checked. These checks can be undertaken by a Typical Steeple Keeper; but points 2 and 3 can only be rectified by a Bell Hanger.\nSome older ball bearings may have a grease nipple. This does NOT mean they require the grease to be ‘topped up’ regularly – that is a certain way of damaging the seals. Do not use a grease gun on these. The results of over greasing can be seen in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: The unfortunate effect of forcing grease into a ball bearing\nAs noted above, ball bearings are not working in an ideal regime. Even if no problems are experienced, it may be prudent to seek advice from a Bell Hanger on ball bearings more than 10 to 15 years old, especially if the bells are heavily used.\nPlain Bearings # Description # A plain bearing (“journal bearing” in engineering parlance) comprises a shaft rotating within a journal. The shaft and journal are made of different materials and the bearing requires lubrication – wear is avoided by the shaft floating on a thin film of oil as it rotates. For a bell, the ‘shaft’ is the steel gudgeon attached to the headstock (the moving part) and the ‘journal’ is a ‘bearing brass’ (sometimes made of bronze) attached to the bell frame (the fixed part). A typical bearing brass, of a type used since the Middle Ages, is shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Parts of a typical plain bearing brass\nThe bearing brass (A) is wedge shaped. Traditionally it was fitted directly into an oak frame; more recently it would be fitted into a metal bedplate attached to the frame. The gudgeon revolves in the groove (B), with a reservoir for the oil (C). The top edges of the groove (D) may be chamfered to conduct surplus oil back to the reservoir. There is a slot (E) for inserting a chisel to remove the bearing. This is a task for a bell hanger, not a Steeple Keeper.\nFigure 4: Parts of a plain bearing assembly\nFigure 4 shows bearings on two bedplates which would be attached to the frame by hold down bolts through the holes at (A). The bearing brass (B) is inserted into the bedplate and the slot for the oil reservoir can be seen at (C). In this design, a felt pad would be placed on top of the gudgeon before the lid (D) is closed. This helps to help distribute the oil around the gudgeon. Note that failure to close the lid leads to loss of lubricant and can cause a bearing to seize.\nFigure 5: Alternative plain bearing assembly with oil reservoir\nFigure 5 shows an alternative design. Again, the holes for hold down bolts and the bearing brass can be seen at A and B, respectively. In this design, the oil is supplied from above in the reservoir (C), which contains a felt wick. The oil can be topped up through the small hole in the top of the reservoir.\nIn most engineering applications, journal bearings will operate with a steady rotation maintaining the oil film. In full circle ringing, however, the bell comes to rest with mouth upwards then turns in the opposite direction. At this point the oil film compresses and this has a very marginal braking effect on the bell. Some ringers feel that this helps to control the bell near the balance. This may be a myth: you need to make up your own mind.\nMost plain bearings allow a small amount of end float, but they are not self-aligning. This means that the gudgeons must be accurately aligned on installation. This presents a problem for wooden frames which may distort with time. This can lead to ‘pinching’ resulting in sudden dropping of the bell. This should not be a problem for plain bearings correctly mounted on metal frames.\nRegular checks and maintenance # This describes the work which should be carried out regularly by a Typical Steeple Keeper. Dealing with more fundamental problems is described below in Problems with Bearings. The main routine task for plain bearings is lubrication. Traditionally, castor oil was used – more specifically the ‘veterinary grade’. This may be difficult to procure, and an alternative is the oil developed to lubricate the chain on chainsaws. This contains a component to enhance the ‘anti-fling’ property needed for chainsaws and this may help to maintain the lubrication of the bearing. During lubrication, it is important to keep the area around the bearing clean to avoid ingress of any abrasive particles, such as dust and grit from tower masonry.\nDo not use grease as a lubricant. It forms an arch over the revolving part and never reaches where it is needed.\nThe recommendation is to lubricate little and often, preferably before each ringing session. A Steeple Keeper may find this unduly onerous: this is probably the major objection to the use of plain bearings.\nDuring a routine inspection, the Steeple Keeper should carry out two other checks:\nWith the bearing cap open, check for any scoring on the gudgeon. This may indicate abrasive particles in the bearing. If it becomes severe it may be necessary to clean the bearing. This requires lifting the bell which, as noted earlier, is a job for a Bell Hanger. For a wooden frame, check that frame movement or damage has not caused the bearing to move. Again, if this is the case, it is a job for a Bell Hanger. Problems with Bearings # DANGER: Extreme care must be exercised when carrying out the tests described in this section and two people (at least) must be present. Even when swinging through a small angle a bell can cause considerable damage if clothing or body parts become trapped. Even if no obvious problems have been detected, the ‘go’ of one or more bells may have become worse, on either plain or ball bearings. Ultimately, this is a problem for a Bell Hanger, but a Typical Steeple Keeper can get some information by listening carefully as the bell is swung by a SMALL amount while DOWN. Any squeaking, grinding or rumbling may indicate a problem and will signal the need for an expert opinion.\nFor this to work, other extraneous noise must be minimised:\nThe clapper should be tied to remove any noise from the clapper bush. The rope should be tied clear to remove noise from pulleys, loose bosses and rope chutes, and the bell swung by hand. A further test would be to swing several bells by the same small amount and check the times taken for the bell to come to rest. A time much shorter than for bells of similar weight could indicate a bearing problem.\nA Final Warning # To reiterate what we have said above: a Steeple Keeper must NOT attempt to dismantle bearings, plain or ball, and must not undertake any work which involves lifting a bell, even by levering it up a small amount.\nImage Credits # Figure Details 1 Ball bearing on the Tenor bell at Gloucester Cathedral.

It is a two-way communication – the ringer uses the rope to control the movement of the bell, while the rope provides information on the position of the bell and how fast it is moving.\nThe rope may have to negotiate obstacles between the bell and the ringer, such as pulleys, rope guides, rope chutes, sound attenuation boxes and rope bosses. These are covered in Rope Routes.\nRope Construction # Ropes are built up in three stages: First, fibres are gathered and spun into yarns. For ropes made of natural fibres (such as hemp or flax), Rope Makers may buy yarns ready spun: they resemble string. A group of yarns is then twisted to form a strand and three (or possibly four) strands are twisted together to form a rope. At each stage, the direction of twist is reversed - this gives stability and strength to the final rope.\nIt is important to note that the fibres in a natural rope are not continuous: the yarn can easily be picked apart. The successive reverse twists provide friction to hold the fibres together. This is illustrated in Figure 1, taken from A Seaman’s Pocket Book, 1943. (‘Hawser – laid’ is a traditional term for a three-strand rope.)\nFigure 1: The components of a natural fibre rope\nSince the 1970s, polyester ropes have been used for top ends of bell ropes. Some people still refer to this as ‘Terylene’, a brand name of that era which is no longer used. Other man-made materials have been used, so we will just refer to ‘artificial fibre’ to avoid confusion. While these ropes are still made up from strands, the fibres making up the strands are continuous.\nArtificial ropes with a braided outer cover have been developed for nautical and climbing applications. An early example was Dyneema® and this name is commonly used, although other versions are available. These products have been used for the top ends of bell ropes because of their very low stretch and hard-wearing properties.\nParts of a bell rope # Figure 2: Parts of a bell rope\nThe demands are different on different parts of a bell rope, shown in Figure 2:\nThe top end (A) needs to resist the atmosphere in the bell chamber and the wear and flexing experienced on the route to the ringing room. Where a top end is made of artificial fibre, a splice (B) is used to join the artificial top end to the bottom end. There are two possibilities: When a new rope is made with an artificial top end, the natural fibre of the bottom end is combined with the artificial fibre during manufacture to produce a ‘machine splice’ with very little change in the diameter of the rope, as can be seen at (B). This can only be done by a rope maker. If the sally and tail end of an existing natural fibre rope are in good condition, an artificial fibre top end can be spliced on, usually with a short splice. This can be done, if needed, by a Steeple Keeper experienced in splicing. A suitable artificial fibre top end can be sourced from a Rope Maker. Top end rope, be it natural or artificial, is not kind on ringers’ hands and natural fibre, wound to give a softer rope, is used for the bottom end of the rope – that part handled by the ringer. The two areas where the rope is handled are: The Sally (C), handled at the handstroke, is made of wool fibres incorporated into the rope as it is made. The Tail End (D), handled at the backstroke, is doubled back and tucked in. This allows adjustment of the tail end length and makes it more comfortable to handle. The very end of the rope will be finished (the term is ‘whipped’) to prevent fraying and to assist in tucking in the rope, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: Example of whipping at end of a tail end rope\nNatural or artificial? # Most steeple keepers would nowadays accept the benefits of using artificial fibre for the top ends of bell ropes:\nIt resists damage from the damp atmosphere in a bell chamber. It resists wear. It resists damage caused by the bending of the rope as it exits the garter hole. Yorkshire tail ends # Figure 4: Yorkshire tail ends\nIt would be remiss not to mention Yorkshire tail ends. These have a small sally (Figure 4) at the tail end, rather than a doubled-back rope. Most Rope Makers can provide them if required. The Whiting Society have an article on Yorkshire tail ends here.\nOrdering new ropes # As the details of towers may vary, we would advise discussing your needs with a Rope Maker. Also consider consulting a Rope Maker if you have inherited a rope that needs replacing: if you don’t know the history, the old rope may not have optimum dimensions.\nSpiders # Figure 5: A typical spider\nA spider is a device usually used to hoist bell ropes up to the ceiling when not in use, as shown in the Title Picture and Figure 5. The spider is a wood or metal object (often decorative) with hooks for the ropes. It is suspended on a cord which passes over one or more pulleys before coming down to a fixing point in the ringing room.\nThe spider is not there just to make the ringing room look tidy – it may be necessary to use it to secure the ropes from unwanted tampering. This will be discussed further in in the online document Running a Tower (currently in preparation). That document will also cover decisions about where to place the spider and its cord within the ringing room.\nThe spider should stop above normal head height, to avoid possible injury if the cord is accidentally let go. This can usually be achieved by running the cord through an eyebolt or similar above the fixing point, with a knot (ideally a ‘Figure-eight’ knot) to catch the cord at a safe height, as shown (arrowed) in Figure 6.\nFigure 6: A knot (arrowed) prevents the spider dropping below head height\nChecking # The condition of the ropes should be checked regularly at the following areas as set out in the [link to Maintenance Schedule].\nGarter hole # This is the point where the rope emerges from the wheel. Here it will experience tight turns in both directions as the bell swings from handstroke to backstroke. This is an area of greatest wear and must be checked regularly. The garter hole and the bobbins [link to Wheels] should also be checked for smoothness and possible loose screws.\nNatural fibre ropes are prone to this form of wear, and it is good practice to adjust the rope up and down a little to spread the wear. Artificial fibre ropes are usually more resistant to this type of wear but should still be checked at this point.\nPulleys, Bosses, Rope Chutes \u0026amp; Rope Guides # These areas are described in [link to Rope Routes]. A particular area of wear, possibly worse than that at the garter hole, is about 45cm (18 in) from the garter hole, where the rope passes over the ground pulley. The wear arises from the rope having to accelerate and decelerate the pulley at every stroke.\nUnless you are lucky enough to have straight drops from the ground pulley to the ringers there will be general wear resulting from other components which may rub against the rope or change its direction. But this will be distributed along a length of the rope and is not a major problem unless there is a ‘rogue component’ causing more local wear. This should be detected by the checks described in [link to Rope Routes]. Once again, the problem is minimised using artificial fibre top ends.\nSally # A sally might experience wear at its top if it passes through a rope guide or a boss in a low ceiling. There may also be wear within the length of a sally if it falls within a boss or rope guide at backstroke. Factors like this should be made known to a rope maker when ordering ropes as it may be possible to adjust the sally to compensate.\nIf woollen strands are sticking out from a sally you can carefully trim them off. Do not attempt to pull them out. However, if the sally is dropping wool or starting to come apart you should contact a rope maker as a repair may be possible.\nTail end # Tail ends are often the first part of a rope to need repair. There are two main causes:\nOn larger bells, with their bigger wheels, the rope may repeatedly hit the floor when the bell is rung. Ropes perform best in tension and the bottom of a loop hitting the floor horizontally may open the strands. This parts the fibres and loosens the rope structure, leading to wear at this point. There is a view that rope mats will help to avoid wear, so long as they are made of wool, rather than artificial fibre. Apart from that possibility, you can either live with this or install permanent boxes on affected bells. Ringers adjusting the tail end length. This may take two forms: Untucking and tucking the tail end, common before the start of a peal or quarter peal. This is acceptable, provided it is done carefully, using a wooden spike, known as a fid, to separate the strands. Metal spikes should not be used: the risk of damaging the strands is too great. Tying a knot – usually a ‘Figure-eight’ knot – to shorten a long rope. This is a short-term measure – perhaps just for one touch at a practice. This is acceptable so long as the knot is removed after use – if a knot is left in for too long it tightens, with possible damage to the rope when it is eventually untied. Also, knots should be removed before bells are lowered. Spider cord \u0026amp; pulleys # The spider cord will be of smaller diameter than a bell rope and the pulleys will probably be less sophisticated than bell pulleys. It is important to check for wear on the cord and free running of the pulleys.\nRepairs # If ropes are kept in a good condition, with regular checks for wear and other damage, a rope should not break during ringing. But a Steeple Keeper will need to be able to deal with wear or other damage before a breakage, or to replace a rope. Also, there may be an urgent need to deal with a broken rope when visiting a tower not fortunate enough to have a capable Steeple Keeper. Splicing # Most repairs to bell ropes involve splicing. With practice, this can be carried out by the Steeple Keeper. We do not discuss the details further here as excellent guidance from the late Frank Beech is available in ‘Splicing Bell Ropes – Illustrated’, available here.\nWith natural fibre top ends, splicing was often needed because of wear at the garter hole and over the ground pulley. There was a common recommendation to order ropes longer than required to provide extra rope for repairs, with the excess being tied off at the wheel. With the much better wear properties of artificial fibre top ends this is not necessary.\nThe need for repair of a tail end is more likely and this can be carried out by a Steeple Keeper competent in making a short splice. Note that this must be done using ‘tail end’ rope to provide suitably soft handling. Bell Hangers and Rope Makers can provide lengths of such rope, with one end finished with a whipping to prevent fraying (see Figure 3). Even if a tail end seems to be beyond repair, it is worth discussing this with a rope maker. There may be other options available which are cheaper than a new rope.\nSpare ropes # If a repair cannot be carried out quickly, it may be useful to have a spare rope available. There is no need to hold a complete set of spare ropes: that is a waste of space and money. Depending on the range of sizes between your Treble and Tenor, up to three spares should be adequate to provide a temporary replacement for any bell.\nSpare ropes should not be kept in a poorly ventilated cupboard. Ideally, they should be hung in a tidy coil in the ringing room, possibly in sacking bags. Fitting a new rope # This is a job for at least two people: one in the bell chamber and the other in the ringing room. The Health \u0026amp; Safety aspects described in Health \u0026amp; Safety must be considered. Ideally, two people in the bell chamber would be preferable – at the least, an assistant can hold the rope in position while it is tied off on the wheel.\nUnless you have a very straight drop from the bell to the ringing room, it is much easier if two ropes are involved. For simplicity, we will call these the ‘new’ and ‘old’ ropes. You have a choice:\nIn the ringing room, tie the top of the new rope to the old rope’s tail end and pull the new one up using the old rope, or Take the new rope up to the bell chamber, tie the bottom of the new rope to the top of the old rope and lower the old rope down. Either option finishes with a whole bell rope in the bell chamber, with the risk of it getting tangled or dirty. (This is where an assistant in the bell chamber is valuable.) If this is an issue, you could consider obtaining a thinner plain feeding rope and using that to lower the old rope and then pull up the new one. The top end of the new rope is then fed through the garter hole on the wheel and gently pulled up until the assistant in the ringing room stops the rope at the correct sally height.\nThere are various ways of establishing the correct sally height. One option is to keep a record of the correct distance between the bottom of each sally and the floor; another option is to have a wooden stick marked with the correct height for each sally. Pragmatically, if the assistant in the ringing room is an experienced ringer you could just rely on their judgement. The rope is then tied off on the top spokes of the wheel, see Figure 6. Details are given in Splicing Bell Ropes – Illustrated.\nFigure 7: Rope tied off on the main spokes of the wheel\nImage Credits # Figure Details Title Picture Ropes on a spider at St Germanus, St Germans, Cornwall.

Made of cast bronze (an alloy of about 77% copper and 23% tin), they have been associated with English churches since at least the seventh century. The oldest surviving bells date from about the twelfth century, although these are rarely part of a ring of bells. However, it is not unusual to find a pre-reformation (pre-1534) bell still in use.\nAround the middle of the nineteenth century, some church bells were cast in steel, as a cheaper alternative to bronze. Manufacture was discontinued after about twenty years but some rings of steel bells are still in use.\nDelvelopment of Bells # Figure 1: Parts of a bell\nFigure 1 shows a pre-reformation bell, cast around 1450, and illustrating the main parts of a bell:\n(A) Almost every bell cast before the end of the 19th century had loops cast into the crownn of the bell called ‘canons’ (sometimes ‘cannons’), together with a taller central loop called the ‘argent’ (partly missing on this bell). These were used to suspend the bell from a headstock.\n(B) The top of the bell is termed the ‘crown’.\n(C) is the ‘shoulder’, for obvious reasons.\n(D) is the ‘inscription band’ – incorporated onto the bell during founding. On pre-reformation bells this is usually liturgical – ”SANCTE MICHAEL ORA PRO NOBIS” on this bell. On a modern bell this will usually give the founder’s name and a date.\n(E) is the ‘waist’ of the bell. Modern bells may have an inscription giving more information here.\n(F) is the ‘soundbow’ – the point where the clapper strikes the inside of the bell.\n(G) is the ‘lip’ of the bell.\nAt one time, canons were accidentally (or deliberately) broken or cut off the crown and the bell was then secured to the headstock with bolts passing through the crown. The historical value of canons is now recognised and such bells can continue in use with canon-retaining headstocks – see Headstocks for more details.\nFigure 2: Modern flat-topped bell\nFor over a hundred years, new bells have been cast with flat tops and bolted directly to the headstock with a wood or epoxy spacer, as shown in Figure 2. This bell was cast in 2000 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and installed by Whites of Appleton as the new treble during the augmentation to eight of the ring at Chipping Sodbury.\nChecking for Problems # There is little a Steeple Keeper can do in terms of maintenance of the bells, but regular checking will identify any problems, which may then require action.\nSurface finish # The shiny finish on a new bell will not remain for long: the patina which appears with age on a bronze bell is quite natural and there should be no attempts to remove it. The most that should be done is to remove any deposits or stains which may appear. The bells must also be protected when the frame, headstocks, or other parts of the installation are painted.\nStains on a bell may reveal problems elsewhere. For example:\nOil or grease stains may result from a leaking oil seal on a ball bearing or spillage from lubrication of a plain bearing. Evidence of either of these requires action, as described in Bearings. In earlier times, white spirit was widely used to remove oil or grease, but it is now recognised that this is harmful to health and difficult to dispose of safely. Low volatile organic compound (VOC) degreasers are now widely available and must be used for cleaning. See Health \u0026amp; Safety. Bird droppings will reveal the need to check the tower’s bird protection – possibly damaged netting on the louvres. Small amounts of bird droppings can be removed with a damp cloth, but extensive bird ingress requires specialist cleaning because of the risk of infection, see Health \u0026amp; Safety. Water stains may reveal problems with weather protection, or damage to the roof. This will require action by the church authorities.\nWear on the soundbow # Wear will result from the impact of the clapper on the inside of the soundbow. This normally results in a small area of bright metal.\nThe impact area may become elongated as a result of a worn clapper bush or a loose crown staple. But this should be detected by the checks described in Clappers. In time, the impact area will become deeper. If it becomes deeper than about 10% of the thickness, there is risk of the bell cracking. The extent of wear can be checked by a Steeple Keeper with the use of a pair of outside calipers.\nProcedure for measuring depth of impact area\nMeasure the thickness of the soundbow at its thinnest point using the calipers. Measure the thickness of the soundbow either side of the thinned area at the same distance from the lip of the bell as the centre of the thinned area and calculate the average unworn thickness. If the difference between the worn and unworn thickness is greater than about 10%, then the bell must be checked by a bell hanger. The usual remedy for excessive wear is to rehang the bell turned through 90° (termed ‘quarter turning’). This is definitely a job for a bell hanger and will require approval from the relevant authorities.\nCracking # Figure 3: Bell cracked and broken from a cast-in crown staple\nA cracked bell is a serious problem. Even a small crack may grow and result in a complete failure of the bell (Figure 3). Cracks may be found in the following places:\nThe most likely location is in the crown of a bell with a cast-in iron crown staple, or the remains of one. Iron corrodes with time and the corroded staple expands in the crown of the bell, generating stresses which will ultimately lead to cracking of the bell, as you can see in Figure 3. Given the difficulty of access and the likely surface condition it will be difficult to detect a crack in the crown visually. The only reliable safeguard is to remove all traces of a cast-in staple – see Clappers. Where a bell is hung by its canons, cracks may be found around the canons. This area should be inspected visually at regular intervals, although this inspection may not be reliable because of the surface condition and because cracks may be hidden by the headstock. The only reliable remedy is to avoid stress on the canons by rehanging the bell with a modern canon-retaining headstock. Cracked bells require the services of a bell hanger. A Steeple Keeper may, however, perform a valuable function by recognising the possibility of a problem, or even identifying a possible crack.\nSome cracked bells may be repaired by welding. If feasible, this allows a historic bell to be retained in use safely. But this is NOT routine welding and, currently, there is only one company known to provide the service. Damage from chiming hammers # Bells should be checked for damage if they are used as clock bells, for manual chiming, as part of a carillon or Ellacombe apparatus, or other systems in which hammers strike the bells.\nThe following precautions must be observed to avoid damage to the bells – and to the chiming mechanism:\nAny hammers must be capable of being pulled clear of the bells before full circle ringing. The mechanism for chiming the bells, be it a clock, manual chime or an Ellacombe apparatus, must be correctly installed and maintained in good condition. The mechanism for pulling the hammers clear must be checked regularly. The means for pulling hammers off must be clearly visible in the Ringing Room, and its status must be obvious. If the Ellacombe apparatus is not located in the ringing room, arrangement must be made to ensure that it is locked off when ringing is taking place. Ringers must exercise a culture of always ensuring all hammers are off before ringing starts – and restoring them when ringing finishes. The use of reversible notices saying “chimes on/off” is discouraged since their accuracy cannot be guaranteed and may discourage actual checks. Persons operating an Ellacombe apparatus (who may not be regular ringers) must be instructed in the use of the apparatus: over-enthusiastic use may damage the bells. Chiming hammers are discussed further in Chiming Hammers.\nImage Credits # Figure Details Title Picture The Treble bell at Derby Cathedral.

See Clappers.\nCoach Bolts # Coach bolts (sometimes referred to as \u0026lsquo;Carriage Bolts\u0026rsquo;) are used in a bell installation for bolting a wooden component to either a metal or wooden component - most often to bolt a stay onto a headstock. The square section under the domed head bites into the wood, securing the head while the nut is tightened.\nEllacombe Apparatus # A system intended for tune ringing, consisting of a set of hammers arranged to strike the inside of the bells, operated from the ringing room or lower in the tower by pulling sleeved ropes mounted in a frame, operated by one person. Arrangements MUST be in place to ensure that, when ringing is taking place, the hammers are pulled clear and the apparatus cannot be accidentally operated.\nFid # A pointed instrument made of wood, used to open up the strands of a bell rope for tucking in a tail end, or to open a knot that has worked tight. A marlin spike is similar but is made of metal and should not be used on bell ropes to avoid damage to the rope. The smaller fid shown above was left at a tower as a \u0026rsquo;thank you present\u0026rsquo; by a visiting band, one of whose members is a skilled wood turner.\nFigure-eight Knot # A knot useful for temporary shortening of a tail end or as a \u0026lsquo;stopper knot\u0026rsquo;, for example to prevent a spider dropping too far if the cord is let slip. (The figure above shows the knot before it is pulled tight.)\nFretting # Fretting refers to wear damage of loaded surfaces in contact with little or no lubrication, encountering movement tangential to the surface. Fretting is caused by adhesion of surface asperities, which are then broken by the small movement.\nGarter Hole # A Hole in the rim of a wheel through which the rope passes in order to be secured to the spokes. See Wheels.\nGrease Nipple # Designs vary, but this is a device for lubricating a component with moving parts. A grease gun locks on to the nipple and grease can be pumped in. The picture above is of a grease nipple (arrowed) at the top end of a clapper, which allows lubrication of the clapper bush \u0026ndash; see Clappers. Grease nipples may be found on some ball bearing housings: these are used to charge the bearing with grease on manufacture and should not be pumped with grease during use. This is a sure way of damaging the seals on the bearing \u0026ndash; see Bearings.\nGround Pulley # A pulley in the bottom of the bell pit - the first pulley the rope passes through after leaving the wheel. The rope passes round this pulley as the bell goes up to handstroke. If the rope does not drop vertically at backstroke there will be a second ground pulley in a double pulley block (sometimes called a \u0026lsquo;roller box\u0026rsquo;).\nGudgeons # The steel shafts fixed to the headstock that form the axle about which the bell rotates.\nHeadstock # A wood or metal beam supporting the bell. The wheel, stay and gudgeons are attached to the headstock.\nOutside Caliper # A tool used to measure thickness. Used to check the depth of a clapper impact dent - see Bells.\nPsittacosis # Psittacosis is an infection of birds caused by the bacterium Chlamydia psittaci. Birds can transmit C. psittaci to humans; the resulting infection is also known as psittacosis or ornithosis.\nSpider # A device with hooks on which bell ropes can be hung in order to be raised above head level when not in use.\nTwiddle Pin # A threaded pin either side of a metal headstock, screwed in to contact the clapper staple. Slackening one and tightening the other allows the clapper to be moved to provide an even strike. Officially called \u0026lsquo;clapper adjustment screws\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;clapper centring pins\u0026rsquo;. See Clappers.\nWheel # A circular wooden component attached to the headstock by which the rope is attached to the bell, permitting it to be rung full circle. See Wheels.\nImage Credits # Glossary Item Details Baldric Baldric clapper suspension at Stone, Glos.
