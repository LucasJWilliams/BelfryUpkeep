At the least, the bells may become progressively more difficult to handle, leading to poor striking, discouraging ringers and frightening away learners. At worst, it could result in expensive damage to the installation.
This online document is addressed primarily at Steeple Keepers, who are responsible for carrying out the activities described here.</description></item><item><title>Formal Requirements</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/020-permissions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/020-permissions/</guid><description>Formal Requirements # With very few exceptions, the bell ringers do not own the bells. There will usually be what we will term an Authorising Body that will have a legal responsibility for the tower and its contents.
The Steeple Keeper should be formally appointed by the Authorising Body in a clear, democratic, and traceable way, probably for a defined period of time. Once appointed, the Steeple Keeper should maintain contact with the Authorising Body at frequent intervals.</description></item><item><title>Faculty Jurisdiction Rules</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/030-faculty-rules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/030-faculty-rules/</guid><description>Faculty Jurisdiction Rules # This chapter refers to activities carried out in churches within the jurisdiction of the Church of England. Ringers must remember that the Rules are set out in law, with possible penalties if they are not followed. Meeting the Rules is the responsibility of the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council, and ringers must use their specialist knowledge to assist the Church authorities in any application. Guidance should be sought from the Diocesan Secretary, The Diocesan Bell Advisor, and the local Guild or Association.</description></item><item><title>Health &amp; Safety</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/040-health-and-safety/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/040-health-and-safety/</guid><description>Health &amp;amp; Safety # Consideration of Health &amp;amp; Safety (H&amp;amp;S) is important for all activities within a tower. This chapter covers the specific aspects of H&amp;amp;S when carrying out routine checks and basic maintenance in the bell chamber, in any tower.
Note that there will be an Authorising Body for work carried out in a tower. Within the Church of England this will be the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council; different arrangements may apply in other jurisdictions – see Formal Requirements.</description></item><item><title>Bell Frames</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/050-bell-frames/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/050-bell-frames/</guid><description>Bell Frames # The bell frame is the structure which supports the bells. It fulfils several main roles:
It provides rigidity with an economy of materials and compactness It transmits the vertical and horizontal forces arising from the movement of the bells to the tower walls It provides a fair circle of ropes in the ringing room The design of bell frames has developed over the years as the need changed from simple chiming to full circle ringing, and as newer materials became available.</description></item><item><title>Headstocks</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/060-headstocks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/060-headstocks/</guid><description>Headstocks # A headstock is one of the major structural elements of any bell installation, with each bell being hung from a headstock mounted on bearings on the bell frame. Each headstock carries the full weight of the bell during its rotation through just over a full circle, so they must be maintained in good condition.
Several other major parts of the installation are attached to the headstock:
Details of how the wheel and stay are attached will be found in the relevant chapters.</description></item><item><title>Wheels</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/070-wheels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/070-wheels/</guid><description>Wheels # The basic design of bell wheels has changed little over the past 200 years. The arrangement of the spokes is both traditional and functional, although there may be some variations. A wheel is made in two parts to allow it to be fitted around the headstock. This has the bonus of making it easier to manoeuvre the parts up to the bell chamber.
Naming of Parts # A typical wheel is constructed from eleven different components, some with different historic names.</description></item><item><title>Stays &amp; Sliders</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/080-stays-and-sliders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/080-stays-and-sliders/</guid><description>Stays &amp;amp; Sliders # A Stay is a mechanism which allows a bell to be ‘parked’ (the ringing term is ‘Set’) with its mouth upwards. This is achieved by the stay engaging with a Slider, which allows the bell to go just past the point of balance in either direction.
The stay also acts as a ‘safety valve’. It is designed to break if the bell is set too violently, avoiding damage to other, more expensive, parts of the installation.</description></item><item><title>Clappers</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/090-clappers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/090-clappers/</guid><description>Clappers # This chapter covers:
Background: The various types of clappers, how they are made and suspended within the bell Routine Checking: The ways in which clappers can be checked, both as part of a routine maintenance schedule and to investigate any problems Maintenance: The options for dealing with problems and the level of experience needed to carry them out Final sections cover: Other Information relevant to clappers and Further Reading Background # A clapper assembly comprises four main components:</description></item><item><title>Bearings</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/100-bearings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/100-bearings/</guid><description>Bearings # The main bearings are critical items: in any installation, they support the large mass of metal swinging through a full circle and their condition is fundamental to the ‘go’ of the bell. You may encounter the two types of bearing – plain bearings and ball bearings. We will describe both, but a Typical Steeple Keeper’s main task will be the important role of carrying out the checks described here.</description></item><item><title>Rope Routes</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/110-rope-route/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/110-rope-route/</guid><description>Rope Routes # The rope may encounter many obstacles between the bell and the ringer. The main reasons are:
It is difficult to design a traditional rectangular bell frame with all ropes falling in a perfect circle, especially with constraints on space and the possible need for a two-tier frame. There may be obstacles such as support girders, ladders and clock cases which limit the placement of ropes. Any obstacle to free movement of the rope will have an effect on the handling of the bell.</description></item><item><title>Ropes</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/120-ropes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/120-ropes/</guid><description>Ropes # The rope forms the essential connection between the bell and the ringer. It is a two-way communication – the ringer uses the rope to control the movement of the bell, while the rope provides information on the position of the bell and how fast it is moving.
The rope may have to negotiate obstacles between the bell and the ringer, such as pulleys, rope guides, rope chutes and rope bosses.</description></item><item><title>Bells</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/130-bells/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/130-bells/</guid><description>Bells # Bells are important as the public voice of the church – familiar to those living near or passing by. Made of cast bronze (an alloy of about 77% copper and 23% tin), they have been associated with English churches since at least the seventh century. The oldest surviving bells date from about the twelfth century, although these are rarely part of a ring of bells. However, it is not unusual to find a pre-reformation (pre-1534) bell still in use.</description></item><item><title>Maintenance Schedule</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/150-maintenance-schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/150-maintenance-schedule/</guid><description>Maintenance Schedule # An online version of this will be introduced in due course.
