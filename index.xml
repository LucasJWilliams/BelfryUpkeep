In this chapter we are going to watch a call change peal that is 16 changes long and quite logical. It introduces the principles of 60 on 3rds without going too far. This call change peal will be the target.</description></item><item><title>Acknowledgements</title><link>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/BelfryUpkeep/docs/100-acknowledgements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/BelfryUpkeep/docs/100-acknowledgements/</guid><description>Acknowledgements # Firstly to Bryn Reinstadler, who in writing her eBook Calling it Round showed me how an eBook can be produced and published quickly using Hugo on GitHub. Then to Lucas Williams who rose to the challenge of working out how to write in Hugo and putting all these pages together for me.
The filming in chapters three and four was done by Dan Hunt and then edited by Colin Newman, leader of the CCCBR’s Schools and Youth groups Workgroup.</description></item></channel></rss>
