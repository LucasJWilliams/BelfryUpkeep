I hope that by reading it you will see that ringing call changes in the way they ring them in Devon and the South West, or more particularly the focus on call changes as a performance rather than just as a transition step before .moving on’ to method ringing, could be good for your band.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 1 - They’re different down there</title><link>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/callchanges/docs/020-down-there/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/callchanges/docs/020-down-there/</guid><description>Chapter 1 They’re different down there # When visiting a call change tower in the South West, if they ask which bell you usually ring, don’t be a smart Alec and say “any of them”. That will not endear you to the locals. Just pick a middle bell to be safe. Treble and Tenor are specialist subjects so definitely don’t say the Treble unless you really are an expert, and only say tenor if you don’t really have another option.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 2 - First Principles</title><link>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/callchanges/docs/030-first-principles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/callchanges/docs/030-first-principles/</guid><description>Chapter 2 First Principles # There are a few things that set Devon calls apart from the sort you are used to.
Closed handstoke leads! # OK, so some of your ringers probably ring with closed handstroke leads anyway and you have given up telling them about it. A perfect open handstroke lead is actually quite difficult to achieve, and what is perfect anyway? You may be told to leave a whole bell’s gap, but actually about three quarters of a bell’s gap sounds OK.</description></item><item><title>Chapter 3 – Getting Started</title><link>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/callchanges/docs/040-getting-started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/callchanges/docs/040-getting-started/</guid><description>Chapter 3 – Getting Started # In this chapter I am just going to talk about getting the band ringing rounds with a closed handstroke lead. Even this is quite an exhilarating thing to do and should be your first target. So the treble’s handstroke will strike straight after the tenor’s backstroke has struck and there should be no way of telling which is the handstroke and which is the backstroke without looking.</description></item><item><title>Rope Routes</title><link>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/callchanges/docs/110-rope-route/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/callchanges/docs/110-rope-route/</guid><description>Rope Routes # Under construction</description></item><item><title>Ropes</title><link>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/callchanges/docs/120-ropes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lucasjwilliams.github.io/callchanges/docs/120-ropes/</guid><description>Ropes # Under construction</description></item></channel></rss>
