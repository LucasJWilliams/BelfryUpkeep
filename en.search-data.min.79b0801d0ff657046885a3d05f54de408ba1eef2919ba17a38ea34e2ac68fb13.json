I hope that by reading it you will see that ringing call changes in the way they ring them in Devon and the South West, or more particularly the focus on call changes as a performance rather than just as a transition step before moving to method ringing, could be good for your band.\nI have always been interested in Devon call change ringing, with most of that period of interest being not really understanding why the bands don’t get bored. Coming from a strong method ringing background myself I am very driven by the pursuit of technical challenge, and ringing the same call changes week in week out didn’t seem to cut the mustard.\nHowever I noted that some of my method ringing friends who have rung really difficult stuff and hence are way up into nosebleed inducing heights of the Black Zone, have moved to the South West and embraced call change ringing. That made my ears prick up.\nThen when I became President of the Central Council in 2019 I started thinking about call change ringing a bit more, wondering whether there aren’t actually lots of bands which would be better served if good call change ringing was the target rather than, as happens in all too many towers, call changes being seen as a stepping stone to unfulfilling Bob or Grandsire Doubles.\nAt the start of the pandemic, I joined a Zoom call with some ringers from Suffolk and I talked about having call change ringing as the target, and one attendee said “If I could go back to my tower and say we were going to ring call changes rather than struggling to ring Bob Doubles they’ll love me forever.” In the summer of 2021 we went on a family holiday to Devon and were fortunate enough to find that the Kingsteinton outing to Exeter was on our first day there, and we were invited to join them. This was our first experience of ringing with a top call change band, and we joined with some trepidation. However, we settled in and from that point on I was convinced that this form of change ringing needed to be practiced more widely. The ringing up and down was exceptional!\nThis book therefore is not being written by some seasoned call change professional, but by someone who has started to integrate Devon call change ringing into the repertoire of a method ringing tower because I can see the value of doing it. I am basically writing it as I go along and hope that if you follow this you will also find a fulfilling addition to your repertoire.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/callchanges/docs/015-ultimate-goal/","title":"The Ultimate Goal","section":"Docs","content":"The ultimate goal #  Devon call change ringing done well is a mesmerising sound. There is a continuous stream of notes which is not interrupted by the open handstroke lead that method ringers insert. It is also said that the ringing of bells slightly below the balance generates a different sort of sound to method ringing where the bells go to the balance and stop for longer.\nAs I think it is always good to see what you are aiming at, here are a selection of videos of call change ringers in action.   This video from Meavy in Devon includes the start of the raise and you will notice how all the ringers start to pull together on the first pull, then on the second pull the ropes are slightly spaced out, then on the final pull when they cause the bells to strike, they strike in rounds but very close together.   This is one of my all-time favourite videos – all 12 at Buckfast Abbey being rung up in peal, followed by some call changes.   And just one final defence for the method ringers. When the Central Council ran a YouTube competition during the Covid lockdown in 2020, there were two months where the criteria were films of the best striking on six and eight bells. I had an ulterior motive in proposing this, because I knew that fine call change ringing would be submitted and that a call change piece would win.\nThe very best method ringing bands achieve near perfect striking but usually in peals, but it never gets filmed. Call change peals benefit from being short and the best ringing is often in competition environments. It is not too onerous to put a GoPro on a cupboard and film for 10 minutes. Peal ringers never do this, and the highest quality method ringing is only heard by its exponents.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/callchanges/docs/020-down-there/","title":"Chapter 1 - They’re different down there","section":"Docs","content":"Chapter 1 They’re different down there #  When visiting a call change tower in the South West, if they ask which bell you usually ring, don’t be a smart Alec and say “any of them”. That will not endear you to the locals. Just pick a middle bell to be safe. Treble and Tenor are specialist subjects so definitely don’t say the Treble unless you really are an expert, and only say tenor if you don’t really have another option.\nThere is some slightly different language for method ringing. Method is often used in the singular when method ringers might use plural. “He does method as well” or “That tower does method”. You get used to it.\nMethod towers and call change towers seem to respect each other, and ringers who want to follow either code find the right home for them. Some ringers do both, and some don’t. The Devonshire Association is the call change association while the Guild of Devonshire Ringers caters for those wanting to ring methods.\nFrom the start I am going to annoy some ringers in Cornwall and other parts of the South West by referring to this genre as ‘Devon Call Changes’. The style if practiced elsewhere in the south west, in particular further west than Devon into Cornwall. However Devon Call Changes is an established term and I don’t think it’s my job to come up with a new word for it.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/callchanges/docs/030-first-principles/","title":"Chapter 2 - First Principles","section":"Docs","content":"Chapter 2 First Principles #  There are a few things that set Devon calls apart from the sort you are used to.\nClosed handstoke leads! #  OK, so some of your ringers probably ring with closed handstroke leads anyway and you have given up telling them about it. A perfect open handstroke lead is actually quite difficult to achieve, and what is perfect anyway? You may be told to leave a whole bell’s gap, but actually about three quarters of a bell’s gap sounds OK. The best 12 bell bands perfect something even narrower and call it ‘style’.\nDevon call change ringing is done with closed handstroke leads, which is sometimes referred to elsewhere as ‘cartwheeling’. More about how to do this later.\nRinging up and down #  When the Devon ringers ring in competitions, and most of the rest of the time too, they ring up and down at the beginning and end of each piece of ringing, which they will call a peal. This means they get very good at ringing up and down. Ringing the bells up and down is no longer just a means to an end – it is of equal importance to the rest of the ringing and is where competitions are won and lost.\nHowever, if you are starting your band off ringing in the style you don’t necessarily have to do the ringing up and down bit. Yet.\nFixed peals #  Devon call change peals do not focus on the ‘musical changes’ that you are used to. They don’t go for a set that you might use for a wedding, going for instance from Queens, then Kings, and back, or you might mix Tittums and something else. The Devonians don’t do that, but ring long established and very formulaic sequences that many of the ringers know by heart. To be honest they are not musical in that sense at all, but that’s not the point.\nRinging one of those sequences, the famous “Sixty on Thirds” will be your first target, but there will be stages to go through before that.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/callchanges/docs/040-getting-started/","title":"Chapter 3 – Getting Started","section":"Docs","content":"Chapter 3 – Getting Started #  In this chapter I am just going to talk about getting the band ringing rounds with a closed handstroke lead. Even this is quite an exhilarating thing to do and should be your first target. So the treble’s handstroke will strike straight after the tenor’s backstroke has struck and there should be no way of telling which is the handstroke and which is the backstroke without looking.\nThat tends to be how you ring up, provided you ring up well (easier said than done). Good ringing up keeps the treble striking immediately after the tenor all the way up, and a handstroke gap is only introduced when you get to the top and are approaching setting the bells.\nWhat you need to perfect is ringing rounds quickly with a closed handstroke lead without speeding up and starting to ring down! That can easily happen. Why do I say quickly? Because it sounds better and is easier to keep in rhythm.\nGood Devon call change bands ring fast, with the bells at or slightly below the balance so don’t be scared – push them in.\nThe closed handstroke lead strikes straight after the tenor\nIf you went up into the tower and watched bells being rung to rounds by a band which rings with an open handstroke lead, you would see that at handstroke the bells are at or slightly past the balance, but at backstoke the bell doesn’t get to the balance. That is showing the pause that we have at the handstroke lead.\nFor some inexplicable reason, and I have never really understood this, the pause that you feel at handstroke when ringing the treble disappears the further round the circle you go. It’s really quite exaggerated when you ring the treble, whereas the person on the tenor won’t feel as they are making any adjustment at all. It’s a bit odd.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/callchanges/docs/050-call-changes/","title":"Chapter 4 - A few call changes","section":"Docs","content":"Chapter 4 – A few call changes #  Once you have mastered the basic rhythm of ringing rounds with a closed handstroke lead it is time to introduce some call changes. In this chapter we are going to watch a call change peal that is 16 changes long and quite logical. It introduces the principles of 60 on 3rds without going too far. This call change peal will be the target.\nAgain this video is of me ringing the treble with five young ringers all of whom were ringing closed handstroke lead call changes for the first time. I rather surprised them, but we had a videographer present for another reason so I took the opportunity to make film specifically for this book. It may be a bit rough around the edges but as with the rounds in the previous chapter, this is a learning process and I hope we show how it is accessible but challenging. To be fair to them they did really well.\nThis video starts when the bells are about two thirds of the way up so the first minute and a half is the end of the raise. These ringers did not know the bells so were learning about the odd-struckness during the raise!\nThen at about 1:43 I start the calls as follows:\n 45 23 25 Those three calls is how the famous “60 on 3rds” starts, by getting the bells into Queens. So watch the video now and pause when the bells get to Queens at about 2:00.    Note how I dispense with the word ‘to’ in between the bell numbers. You don’t need it and in my experience the Devon ringers don’t say it. It is quicker and clearer just to say “45” rather than “4 to 5”. (It is actually the way call changes are done in Birmingham city centre as well so I am used to it.) In case you were wondering whether the bells are called down or up, the answer is up. There is no arguing here. If you’re about to say calling up is somehow wrong, get over it. It’s part of the style.\nSecond thing to note is the rhythm of it. The style is to have the calls at regular metronomic intervals. I am calling the changes every second handstroke, which gives four rows for each change. You could go for every third handstroke to start with, but every second handstroke should be the aim. OK, now go back to the video and play on. What I do next is call the treble up to the back – again this is how 60 on 3rds starts. The calls are:\n 13 (3 leads) 15 12 14 which takes the bells to 352416 Pause at 2:27\n That segment then includes one of the things that is hardest to get right for a band doing this for the first time – a different bell taking the lead and getting the handstroke in the right place straight away. It is quite hard to do because you really have to push the handstroke in, without letting the backstroke drop. Watch the ringer of the 3rd as he is called to lead. Is he just a wincey bit slow?\nGo back to the video and play on again. What happens next is that the 3 comes up one place, making the 5 lead, and then the treble ‘hunts’ back to the front again. 5 has to push in quickly and demonstrates neatly how it is quite difficult to get this right first time. Treble comes down to the front and then I put my hands up and admit I was slow leading too ☹\nSo the calls are:\n 35 41 21 31 51 which takes the bells to 153246 (nice) Pause again\n 60 on 3rds then continues with a systematic process which will be explained in a later chapter but for now I am going to call this back to rounds and it is going to serve as the first practice peal. So, I move the 5 up after 3 to get back into Queens, and call it back to rounds. The calls are:\n 53 52 32 54 which takes the bells to rounds.\n That therefore is the peal I recommend you practice now. It is useful because it introduces some of the principles of 60 on 3rds, bringing it round after a convenient amount of time.\nThe main takeaways from this chapter are:\n•\tRegular changes - try and be consistently two or three handstrokes apart\n•\tThe bell going into lead will need to try very hard not to be slow •\tThis principle of the treble hunting up and down the change is common in Devon call change ringing\n•\tThe tenor ringer needs to be as steady as a rock\n"}]
