I hope that by reading it you will see that ringing call changes in the way they ring them in Devon and the South West, or more particularly the focus on call changes as a performance rather than just as a transition step before .moving on’ to method ringing, could be good for your band.\nI have always been interested in Devon call change ringing, with most of that period of interest being not really understanding why the bands don’t get bored. Coming from a strong method ringing background myself I am very driven by the pursuit of technical challenge, and ringing the same call changes week in week out didn’t seem to cut the mustard.\nHowever I noted that some of my method ringing friends who have rung really difficult stuff and hence are way up into nosebleed inducing heights of the Black Zone, have moved to the South West and embraced call change ringing. That made my ears prick up.\nThen when I became President of the Central Council I started thinking about call change ringing a bit more, wondering whether there aren’t actually lots of bands which would be better served if good call change ringing was the target rather than as happens in all too many towers, call changes is seen as a stepping stone to unfulfilling Bob or Grandsire Doubles.\nAt the start of the pandemic, I joined a Zoom call with some ringers from Suffolk and I talked about having call change ringing as the target, and one attendee said “If I could go back to my tower and say we were going to ring call changes rather than struggling to ring Bob Doubles they’ll love me forever.” In the summer of 2021 we went on a family holiday to Devon and were fortunate enough to find that the Kingsteinton outing to Exeter was on our first day there, and we were invited to join them. This was our first experience of ringing with a top call change band, and we joined with some trepidation. However, we settled in and from that point on I was convinced that this form of change ringing needed to be practiced more widely. The ringing up and down was exceptional!\nThis book therefore is not being written by some seasoned call change professional, but by someone who has started to integrate Devon call change ringing in the repertoire of a method ringing tower because I can see the value of doing it. I am basically writing it as I go along and hope that if you follow this you will also find a fulfilling addition to your repertoire.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/callchanges/docs/020-down-there/","title":"Chapter 1 - They’re different down there","section":"Docs","content":"Chapter 1 They’re different down there #  When visiting a call change tower in the South West, if they ask which bell you usually ring, don’t be a smart Alec and say “any of them”. That will not endear you to the locals. Just pick a middle bell to be safe. Treble and Tenor are specialist subjects so definitely don’t say the Treble unless you really are an expert, and only say tenor if you don’t really have another option.\nThere is some slightly different language for method ringing. Method is often used in the singular when method ringers might use plural. “He does method as well” or “That tower does method”. You get used to it.\nMethod towers and call change towers seem to respect each other, and ringers who want to follow either code find the right home for them. Some ringers do both, and some don’t. The Devonshire Association is the call change association while the Guild of Devonshire Ringers caters for those wanting to ring methods.\nFrom the start I am going to annoy some ringers in Cornwall and other parts of the South West by referring to this genre as ‘Devon Call Changes’. The style if practiced elsewhere in the south west, in particular further west than Devon into Cornwall. However Devon Call Changes is an established term and I don’t think it’s my job to come up with a new word for it.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/callchanges/docs/030-first-principles/","title":"Chapter 2 - First Principles","section":"Docs","content":"Chapter 2 First Principles #  There are a few things that set Devon calls apart from the sort you are used to.\nClosed handstoke leads! #  OK, so some of your ringers probably ring with closed handstroke leads anyway and you have given up telling them about it. A perfect open handstroke lead is actually quite difficult to achieve, and what is perfect anyway? You may be told to leave a whole bell’s gap, but actually about three quarters of a bell’s gap sounds OK. The best 12 bell bands perfect something even narrower and call it ‘style’.\nDevon call change ringing is done with closed handstroke leads, which is sometimes referred to elsewhere as ‘cartwheeling’. More about how to do this later.\nRinging up and down #  When the Devon ringers ring in competitions, and most of the rest of the time too, they ring up and down at the beginning and end of each piece of ringing, which they will call a peal. This means they get very good at ringing up and down. Ringing the bells up and down is no longer just a means to an end – it is of equal importance to the rest of the ringing and is where competitions are won and lost.\nHowever, if you are starting your band off ringing in the style you don’t necessarily have to do the ringing up and down bit. Yet.\nFixed peals #  Devon call change peals do not focus on the ‘musical changes’ that you are used to. They don’t go for a set that you might use for a wedding, going for instance from Queens, then Kings, and back, or you might mix Tittums and something else. The Devonians don’t do that, but ring long established and very formulaic sequences that many of the ringers know by heart. To be honest they are not musical in that sense at all, but that’s not the point.\nRinging one of those sequences, the famous “Sixty on Thirds” will be your first target, but there will be stages to go through before that.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/callchanges/docs/040-getting-started/","title":"Chapter 3 – Getting Started","section":"Docs","content":"Chapter 3 – Getting Started #  In this chapter I am just going to talk about getting the band ringing rounds with a closed handstroke lead. Even this is quite an exhilarating thing to do and should be your first target. So the treble’s handstroke will strike straight after the tenor’s backstroke has struck and there should be no way of telling which is the handstroke and which is the backstroke without looking.\nThat tends to be how you ring up, provided you ring up well (easier said than done). Good ringing up keeps the treble striking immediately after the tenor all the way up, and a handstroke gap is only introduced when you get to the top and are approaching setting the bells.\nWhat you need to perfect is ringing rounds quickly with a closed handstroke lead without speeding up and starting to ring down! That can easily happen. Why do I say quickly? Because it sounds better and is easier to keep in rhythm.\nGood Devon call change bands ring fast, with the bells at or slightly below the balance so don’t be scared – push them in.\nThe closed handstroke lead strikes straight after the tenor\nIf you went up into the tower and watched bells being rung to rounds by a band which rings with an open handstroke lead, you would see that at handstroke the bells are at or slightly past the balance, but at backstoke the bell doesn’t get to the balance. That is showing the pause that we have at the handstroke lead.\nFor some inexplicable reason, and I have never really understood this, the pause that you feel at handstroke when ringing the treble disappears the further round the circle you go. It’s really quite exaggerated when you ring the treble, whereas the person on the tenor won’t feel as they are making any adjustment at all. It’s a bit odd.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/callchanges/docs/100-bearings/","title":"Bearings","section":"Docs","content":"Bearings #  The main bearings are critical items: in any installation, they support the large mass of metal swinging through a full circle and their condition is fundamental to the ‘go’ of the bell. You may encounter the two types of bearing – plain bearings and ball bearings. We will describe both, but a Typical Steeple Keeper’s main task will be the important role of carrying out the checks described here. This will help identify any problems before they reach a critical stage.\nA Typical Steeple Keeper can only carry out basic maintenance on bearings: for example, lubrication of plain bearings. Major jobs will usually require the lifting of a bell, even by a small amount, and this is a job for Bell Hangers, who carry the necessary insurances and requirements of Health \u0026amp; Safety regulations. Also, within the jurisdiction of the Church of England, there will be a legal requirement to obtain a faculty for such work. Further details are given in Formal Requirements, Faculty Jurisdiction Rules and Health \u0026amp; Safety.  Ball Bearings #  Description #  Ball bearings started to be fitted to bells only in the early 1920s but their use since then is almost universal, so these are the ones you are most likely to experience.\nFigure 1: Ball bearing - the split for assembly is arrowed\nA ball bearing (Figure 1) is a sealed unit that should require no regular maintenance. The bearing consists of one (or possibly two) rings of hardened steel balls running between two hardened steel tracks. The inner ring is mounted on the gudgeon and the outer on the bearing housing, mounted on the frame. On assembly, the bearings are filled with grease which is retained by seals. The grease provides some lubrication to prevent fretting between the balls and the track, but its main use is to protect the components from rusting.\nDesigns vary, but the type of bearing shown in Figure 1 is split for assembly along the line arrowed. Do not try to separate the two halves during routine checks.\nThe ball bearings used for bell hanging are self-aligning, allowing for small movements of the bell frame – particularly important for wooden frames. Lateral movement, resulting from small movements between the two side frames, is accommodated by a small amount of lateral travel (often termed ‘end float’) on one bearing, usually the one on the wheel side.\nIn many engineering applications, ball bearings provide prolonged satisfactory operation. But the alternating direction of rotation of the bell when ringing is not ideal, and neither are impacts on the bell from clock or chiming hammers. Impacts from chiming hammers is particularly harmful, as the film of grease may not be replenished when the bell is stationary, leading to metal-to-metal contact between the balls and the track.\nRegular checks and maintenance #  Unless you suspect a problem with ball bearings (see Problems with Bearings), the only checks you should undertake are:\n Check the tightness of the bolts holding the bearing to the frame. Check for leakage of grease from the end seals. Check clearances at either side – a bell can ‘travel’ sideways slightly, especially when subjected to a heavy clock hammer. This is unusual but should be checked.   These checks can be undertaken by a Typical Steeple Keeper; but points 2 and 3 can only be rectified by a Bell Hanger.\nSome older ball bearings may have a grease nipple. This does NOT mean they require the grease to be ‘topped up’ regularly – that is a certain way of damaging the seals. Do not use a grease gun on these. The results of over greasing can be seen in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: The unfortunate effect of forcing grease into a ball bearing\nAs noted above, ball bearings are not working in an ideal regime. Even if no problems are experienced, it may be prudent to seek advice from a Bell Hanger on ball bearings more than 10 to 15 years old, especially if the bells are heavily used.\nPlain Bearings #  Description #  A plain bearing (“journal bearing” in engineering parlance) comprises a shaft rotating within a journal. The shaft and journal are made of different materials and the bearing requires lubrication – wear is avoided by the shaft floating on a thin film of oil as it rotates. For a bell, the ‘shaft’ is the steel gudgeon attached to the headstock (the moving part) and the ‘journal’ is a ‘bearing brass’ (sometimes made of bronze) attached to the bell frame (the fixed part). A typical bearing brass, of a type used since the Middle Ages, is shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Parts of a typical plain bearing brass\nThe bearing brass (A) is wedge shaped. Traditionally it was fitted directly into an oak frame; more recently it would be fitted into a metal bedplate attached to the frame. The gudgeon revolves in the groove (B), with a reservoir for the oil (C). The top edges of the groove (D) may be chamfered to conduct surplus oil back to the reservoir. There is a slot (E) for inserting a chisel to remove the bearing. This is a task for a bell hanger, not a Steeple Keeper.\nFigure 4: Parts of a plain bearing assembly\nFigure 4 shows bearings on two bedplates which would be attached to the frame by hold down bolts through the holes at (A). The bearing brass (B) is inserted into the bedplate and the slot for the oil reservoir can be seen at (C). In this design, a felt pad would be placed on top of the gudgeon before the lid (D) is closed. This helps to help distribute the oil around the gudgeon. Note that failure to close the lid leads to loss of lubricant and can cause a bearing to seize.\nFigure 5: Alternative plain bearing assembly with oil reservoir\nFigure 5 shows an alternative design. Again, the holes for hold down bolts and the bearing brass can be seen at A and B, respectively. In this design, the oil is supplied from above in the reservoir (C), which contains a felt wick. The oil can be topped up through the small hole in the top of the reservoir.\nIn most engineering applications, journal bearings will operate with a steady rotation maintaining the oil film. In full circle ringing, however, the bell comes to rest with mouth upwards then turns in the opposite direction. At this point the oil film compresses and this has a very marginal braking effect on the bell. Some ringers feel that this helps to control the bell near the balance. This may be a myth: you need to make up your own mind.\nMost plain bearings allow a small amount of end float, but they are not self-aligning. This means that the gudgeons must be accurately aligned on installation. This presents a problem for wooden frames which may distort with time. This can lead to ‘pinching’ resulting in sudden dropping of the bell. This should not be a problem for plain bearings correctly mounted on metal frames.\nRegular checks and maintenance #  This describes the work which should be carried out regularly by a Typical Steeple Keeper. Dealing with more fundamental problems is described below in Problems with Bearings.  The main routine task for plain bearings is lubrication. Traditionally, castor oil was used – more specifically the ‘veterinary grade’. This may be difficult to procure, and an alternative is the oil developed to lubricate the chain on chainsaws. This contains a component to enhance the ‘anti-fling’ property needed for chainsaws and this may help to maintain the lubrication of the bearing. During lubrication, it is important to keep the area around the bearing clean to avoid ingress of any abrasive particles, such as dust and grit from tower masonry.\nDo not use grease as a lubricant. It forms an arch over the revolving part and never reaches where it is needed.\nThe recommendation is to lubricate little and often, preferably before each ringing session. A Steeple Keeper may find this unduly onerous: this is probably the major objection to the use of plain bearings.\nDuring a routine inspection, the Steeple Keeper should carry out two other checks:\n With the bearing cap open, check for any scoring on the gudgeon. This may indicate abrasive particles in the bearing. If it becomes severe it may be necessary to clean the bearing. This requires lifting the bell which, as noted earlier, is a job for a Bell Hanger. For a wooden frame, check that frame movement or damage has not caused the bearing to move. Again, if this is the case, it is a job for a Bell Hanger.   Problems with Bearings #  DANGER: Extreme care must be exercised when carrying out the tests described in this section and two people (at least) must be present. Even when swinging through a small angle a bell can cause considerable damage if clothing or body parts become trapped.  Even if no obvious problems have been detected, the ‘go’ of one or more bells may have become worse, on either plain or ball bearings. Ultimately, this is a problem for a Bell Hanger, but a Typical Steeple Keeper can get some information by listening carefully as the bell is swung by a SMALL amount while DOWN. Any squeaking, grinding or rumbling may indicate a problem and will signal the need for an expert opinion.\nFor this to work, other extraneous noise must be minimised:\n The clapper should be tied to remove any noise from the clapper bush. The rope should be tied clear to remove noise from pulleys, loose bosses and rope chutes, and the bell swung by hand.  A further test would be to swing several bells by the same small amount and check the times taken for the bell to come to rest. A time much shorter than for bells of similar weight could indicate a bearing problem.\nA Final Warning #  To reiterate what we have said above: a Steeple Keeper must NOT attempt to dismantle bearings, plain or ball, and must not undertake any work which involves lifting a bell, even by levering it up a small amount.\nImage Credits #     Figure Details     1 Ball bearing on the Tenor bell at Gloucester Cathedral.

They are linked from the text in the various chapters.\nArgent #  The central boss on the crown of older bells, around which the canons are grouped. These are used to attach the bell to the headstock.\nBaldrick #  A U-shaped metal strap with leather lining from which clappers used to be suspended. The name originates from a belt worn over one shoulder to support a sword or bugle and is sometimes referred to as a \u0026lsquo;baldric\u0026rsquo;.\nCanons #  (Sometimes \u0026lsquo;Cannons\u0026rsquo;). The loops cast onto the crown of older bells, by which the bells is suspended from the headstock.\nClapper #  The component suspended inside a bell which, when the bell is swung, strikes the bell to produce the note. See Clappers.\nCoach Bolts #  Coach bolts (sometimes referred to as \u0026lsquo;Carriage Bolts\u0026rsquo;) are used in a bell installation for bolting a wooden component to either a metal or wooden component - most often to bolt a stay onto a headstock. The square section under the domed head bites into the wood, securing the head while the nut is tightened.\nFretting #  Fretting refers to wear damage of loaded surfaces in contact with little or no lubrication, encountering movement tangential to the surface. Fretting is caused by adhesion of surface asperities, which are then broken by the small movement.\nGrease Nipple #  Designs vary, but this is a device for lubricating a component with moving parts. A grease gun locks on to the nipple and grease can be pumped in. The picture above is of a grease nipple (arrowed) on a clapper clevis, which allows lubrication of the clapper bush \u0026ndash; see Clappers. Grease nipples may be found on ball bearing housings: these are used to charge the bearing with grease on manufacture and should not be pumped with grease during use. This is a sure way of damaging the seals on the bearing \u0026ndash; see Bearings.\nGudgeons #  The steel shafts fixed to the headstock that form the axle about which the bell rotates.\nHeadstock #  A wood or metal beam supporting the bell. The wheel, stay and gudgeons are attached to the headstock.\nPsittacosis #  Psittacosis is an infection of birds caused by the bacterium Chlamydia psittaci. Birds can transmit C. psittaci to humans; the resulting infection is also known as psittacosis or ornithosis.\nWheel #  A circular wooden component attached to the headstock by which the rope is attached to the bell, permitting it to be rung full circle.
