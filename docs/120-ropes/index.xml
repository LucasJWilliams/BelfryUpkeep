It is a two-way communication – the ringer uses the rope to control the movement of the bell, while the rope provides information on the position of the bell and how fast it is moving.
The rope may have to negotiate obstacles between the bell and the ringer, such as pulleys, rope guides, rope chutes and rope bosses.</description></item><item><title>Rope Driers</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/120-ropes/rope-driers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/120-ropes/rope-driers/</guid><description>Appendix: Rope Driers for Bell Towers - Some Suggestions # Ringers may wish to use a ‘rope drier’ to reduce stiffness in bell ropes that become damp in an unheated ringing room. Driers are usually designed and assembled by volunteers. However, questions have been raised about some of the rope driers that have been seen during checks and inspections of churches and towers. For non-ringers, it is not immediately evident what the units are used for or how they are to be used.</description></item></channel></rss>
