It is a two-way communication â€“ the ringer uses the rope to control the movement of the bell, while the rope provides information on the position of the bell and how fast it is moving.
The rope may have to negotiate obstacles between the bell and the ringer, such as pulleys, rope guides, rope chutes and rope bosses.</description></item></channel></rss>
