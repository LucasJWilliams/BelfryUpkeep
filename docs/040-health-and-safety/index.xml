This chapter covers the specific aspects of H&amp;amp;S when carrying out routine checks and basic maintenance in the bell chamber, in any tower.
Note that there will be an Authorising Body for work carried out in a tower. Within the Church of England this will be the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council; different arrangements may apply in other jurisdictions â€“ see Formal Requirements.</description></item><item><title>Avian Flu</title><link>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/040-health-and-safety/avian-flu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/040-health-and-safety/avian-flu/</guid><description>Appendix: Cleaning Bell Chambers Contaminated with Bird Waste or Carcasses # With reference to avian influenza / bird flu # UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Birds finding their way into towers, particularly bell chambers, has been an issue that ringers have had to deal with and try to prevent for as long as bells have been hung in towers. I find it interesting to think that back in the 1300&amp;rsquo;s some monastery servant, sexton or local labourer would have been tasked with climbing the tower with a sack and a shovel to remove sticks, nests and carcasses just as I have done.</description></item></channel></rss>
