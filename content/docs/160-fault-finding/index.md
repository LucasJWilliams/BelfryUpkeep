# Fault Finding

## Common Problems with Bells

This [downloadable PDF](static/SM_CommonProblems_2021_v3_1.pdf), originally produced as a separate document on the Central Council website, offers a way of identifying some of the more common faults with bells and indicates how they may be solved. The difficulty and urgency of each diagnosis is indocated by codes, along with a guide to permissions which may be required before work is carried out (based on the [Faculty Jurisdiction Rules](/docs/030-faculty-rules)). Less experienced Steeple Keepers should consult the relevant chapter(s) in this document before attempting to carry out any work.
