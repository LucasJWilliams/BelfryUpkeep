Welcome to *Belfry Upkeep*. This online document, produced by the Central Council Stewardship & Management Workgroup, is aimed at the Steeple Keeper -- the one responsible for keeping the bells in order. You may be an established Steeple Keeper, or one just new to the job, or someone wondering if you should take it on.

Our aims in this document are:

- To help you understand the installation in your tower (they are all different, in detail at least)
- To describe the checks you should carry out to identify any problems
- To advise you on the maintenance tasks that you should be able to carry out, possibly with expert advice or assistance
- Most importantly, to help you recognise the tasks that require specialist knowledge from a Bell Hanger or other expert

{{< hint warning >}}
The Stewardship & Management Workgroup have produced two other
documents:
  - **[Belfry Projects](https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/)**, which
    offers advice to anyone who is considering a project to install
    bells or undertake restoration work on a bell installation in a bell
    tower.
 - **[Running a Tower](https://runningatower.cccbr.org.uk/)**, which is
    aimed at the Tower Captain - the person with overall responsibility
    for looking after all aspects of a tower.

## Finding Your Way Round

If you are working on a computer browser (or on a tablet in landscape orientation) you will see a navigation menu with links to all the chapters on the left, and a menu with links to sections in the current chapter on the right. On a narrower screen (a phone or a tablet in portrait orientation), you will need to click on the menu icons (three stacked horizontal lines) at the top of the page to see either menu. Another click takes you back to the full text. For those who want to read the document straight through, and to help those reading on small screens, there are links at the end of each chapter to the next and the previous chapter.

Within the text, links to sections within the current chapter, to other chapters, and to external web references are shown in blue. Links shown in ***bold italic*** blue refer to entries in the 'Glossary' chapter.

## Image Credits

Credits will be found at the end of each chapter. The picture on this page shows the six bells of St Thomas the Martyr, Up Holland, Lancashire, UK raised ready for ringing. This was the winner of the *Bells and Installations* round of the Central Council photographic competition. (Photo: Phil Hope)
